<h2>Matching Green.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>A quaint old Essex village of single-storied cottages, some ivy
mantled, with dormer windows, thatched roofs, and miniature
gardens, strewed with picturesque irregularity round as fine a
green as you will find in the county. Its normal condition is
rustic peace and sleepy beatitude; and it pursues the even tenor of
its way undisturbed by anything more exciting than a meeting of the
vestry, the parish dinner, the advent of a new curate, or the exit
of one of the fathers of the hamlet.</p>
<p>But this morning the place is all agog, and so transformed that
it hardly knows itself. The entire population, from the oldest
gaffer to the last-born baby, is out-of-doors; the two inns are
thronged with guests, and the road is lined with all sorts and
conditions of carriages, from the four-in-hand of the wealthy swell
to the donkey-cart of the local coster-monger. From every point of
the compass are trooping horsemen, some resplendent in scarlet
coats, their nether limbs clothed in immaculate white breeches and
shining top-boots, others in pan hats and brown leggings; and all
in high spirits and eager for the fray; for to-day, according to
old custom, the Essex Hunt hold the first regular meet of the
season on Matching&rsquo;s matchless Green.</p>
<p>The master is already to the fore, and now comes Tom Cuffe, the
huntsman, followed by his hounds, whose sleek skins and bright
coats show that they are &ldquo;fit to go,&rdquo; and whose eager
looks bode ill to the long-tailed denizens of copse and covert.</p>
<p>It still wants a few minutes to eleven, and the interval is
occupied in the interchange of greetings between old companions of
the chase, in desultory talk about horses and hounds; and while
some of the older votaries of Diana fight their battles o&rsquo;er
again, and describe thrice-told historic runs, which grow longer
with every repetition, others discuss the prospects of the coming
season, and indulge in hopes of which, let us hope, neither Jack
Frost, bad scent, nor accident by flood or field will mar the
fruition.</p>
<p>Nearly all are talking, for there is a feeling of
<em>camaraderie</em> in the hunting-field which dispenses with the
formality of introductions, its frequenters sometimes becoming
familiar friends before they have learned each other&rsquo;s
names.</p>
<p>Yet there are exceptions; and one cavalier in particular appears
to hold himself aloof, neither speaking to his neighbors nor mixing
in the throng. As he does not look like a &ldquo;sulky
swell,&rdquo; rendered taciturn by an overweening sense of his own
importance, he is probably either a new resident in the county or a
&ldquo;stranger from a distance&rdquo;&mdash;which, none whom I ask
seems to know. There is something about this man that especially
attracts my attention; and not mine alone, for I perceive that he
is being curiously regarded by several of my neighbors. His get-up
is faultless, and he sits with the easy grace of a practiced
horseman an animal of exceptional symmetry and strength. His
well-knit figure is slim and almost youthful, and he holds himself
as erect on his saddle as a dragoon on parade. But his closely
cropped hair is turning gray, and his face that of a man far
advanced in the fifties, if not past sixty. And a striking face it
is&mdash;long and oval, with a straight nose and fine nostrils, a
broad forehead, and a firm, resolute mouth. His complexion, though
it bears traces of age, is clear, healthy, and deeply bronzed. Save
for a heavy gray mustache, he is clean shaved; his dark, keenly
observant eyes are overshadowed by black and all but straight
brows, terminating in two little tufts, which give his countenance
a strange and, as some might think, an almost sardonic expression.
Altogether, it strikes me as being the face of a cynical yet not
ill-natured or malicious Mephistopheles.</p>
<p>Behind him are two grooms in livery, nearly as well mounted as
himself, and, greatly to my surprise, he is presently joined by Jim
Rawlings, who last season held the post of first whipper-in.</p>
<p>What manner of man is this who brings out four horses on the
same day, and what does he want with them all? Such horses, too!
There is not one of them that has not the look of a two
hundred-guinea hunter.</p>
<p>I was about to put the question to Keyworth, the hunt secretary,
who had just come within speaking distance, and was likely to know
if anybody did, when the master gave the signal for a move, and
huntsman and hounds, followed by the entire field, went off at a
sharp trot.</p>
<p>We had a rather long ride to covert, but a quick find, a fox
being viewed away almost as soon as the hounds began to draw. It
was a fast thing while it lasted, but, unfortunately, it did not
last long; for, after a twenty minutes&rsquo; gallop, the hounds
threw up their heads, and cast as Cuffe might, he was unable to
recover the line.</p>
<p>The country we had gone over was difficult and dangerous, full
of blind fences and yawning ditches, deep enough and wide enough to
swallow up any horse and his rider who might fail to clear them.
Fortunately, however, I escaped disaster, and for the greater part
of the run I was close to the gentleman with the Mephistophelian
face and Tom Rawlings, who acted as his pilot. Tom rode well, of
course&mdash;it was his business&mdash;but no better than his
master, whose horse, besides being a big jumper, was as clever as a
cat, flying the ditches like a bird, and clearing the blindest
fences without making a single mistake.</p>
<p>After the first run we drew two coverts blank, but eventually
found a second fox, which gave us a slow hunting run of about an
hour, interrupted by several checks, and saved his brush by taking
refuge in an unstopped earth.</p>
<p>By this time it was nearly three o&rsquo;clock, and being a long
way from home, and thinking no more good would be done, I deemed it
expedient to leave off. I went away as Mephistopheles and his man
were mounting their second horses, which had just been brought up
by the two grooms in livery.</p>
<p>My way lay by Matching Green, and as I stopped at the village
inn to refresh my horse with a pail of gruel and myself with a
glass of ale, who should come up but old Tawney, Tom Cuffe&rsquo;s
second horseman! Besides being an adept at his calling, familiar
with every cross-road and almost every field in the county, he knew
nearly as well as a hunted fox himself which way the creature meant
to run. Tawney was a great gossip, and quite a mine of curious
information about things equine and human&mdash;especially about
things equine. Here was a chance not to be neglected of learning
something about Mephistopheles; so after warming Tawney&rsquo;s
heart and opening his lips with a glass of hot whiskey punch, I
began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a new first whip, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, name of Cobbe&mdash;Paul Cobbe. He comes from
the Berkshire country, he do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how is it that Rawlings has left? and who is that
gentleman he was with to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! haven&rsquo;t you heard!&rdquo; exclaimed Tawney,
as surprised at my ignorance as if I had asked him the name of the
reigning sovereign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not heard, which, seeing that I spent the greater
part of the summer at sea and returned only the other day, is
perhaps not greatly to be wondered at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the gentleman as Rawlings has gone to and as he was
with to-day is Mr. Fortescue; him as has taken
Kingscote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingscote was a country-house of no extraordinary size, but with
so large a park and gardens, conservatories and stables so
extensive as to render its keeping up very costly; and the owner or
mortgagee, I know not which, had for several years been vainly
trying to let it at a nominal rent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be rich, then. Kingscote will want a lot of
keeping up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich is not the word, sir. He has more money than he
knows what to do with. Why, he has twenty horses now, and is
building loose-boxes for ten more, and he won&rsquo;t look at one
under a hundred pounds. Rawlings has got a fine place, he has
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised he should have left the kennels, though.
He loses his chance of ever becoming huntsman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is as good as that now, sir. He had a present of fifty
pounds to start with, gets as many shillings a week and all found,
and has the entire management of the stables, and with a gentleman
like Mr. Fortescue there&rsquo;ll be some nice pickings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely. But why does Mr. Fortescue want a pilot? He
rides well, and his horses seem to know their business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t have any as doesn&rsquo;t. Yes, he rides
uncommon well for an aged man, does Mr. Fortescue. I suppose he
wants somebody to show him the way and keep him from getting ridden
over. It isn&rsquo;t nice to get ridden over when you&rsquo;re
getting into years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t nice whether you are getting into years or
not. But you cannot call Mr. Fortescue an old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot call him a young &rsquo;un. He has a good many
gray hairs, and them puckers under his eyes hasn&rsquo;t come in a
day. But he has a young heart, I will say that for him. Did you see
how he did that &lsquo;double&rsquo; as pounded half the
field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was a very sporting jump. But who is Mr.
Fortescue, and where does he come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what nobody seems to know. Mr. Keyworth&mdash;he
was at the kennels only yesterday&mdash;asked me the very same
question. He thought Jim Rawlings might ha&rsquo; told me
something. But bless you, Jim knows no more than anybody else. All
as he can tell is as Mr. Fortescue sometimes goes to London, that
he is uncommon fond of hosses, and either rides or drives tandem
nearly every day, and has ordered a slap-up four-in-hand drag. And
he has got a &rsquo;boratory and no end o&rsquo; chemicals and
stuff, and electric machines, and all sorts o&rsquo;
gimcracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a Mrs. Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I knows on. There is not a woman in the house,
except servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who looks after things, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a housekeeper. But the head
bottle-washer is a chap they call major-domo&mdash;a German he is.
He looks after everything, and an uncommon sharp domo he is, too,
Jim says. Nobody can do him a penny piece. And then there is Mr.
Fortescue&rsquo;s body-servant; he&rsquo;s a dark man, with a big
scar on one cheek, and rings in his ears. They call him
Rumun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! There&rsquo;s no such name as Rumun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told Jim. He said it was a rum
&rsquo;un, but his name was Rumun, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark, and rings in his ears! The man is probably a
Spaniard. You mean Ramon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t; I mean Rumun,&rdquo; returned Tawney,
doggedly. &ldquo;I thought it was an uncommon rum name, and I asked
Jim twice&mdash;he calls at the kennels sometimes&mdash;I asked him
twice, and he said he was cock sure it was Rumun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rumun let it be then. Altogether, this Mr. Fortescue
seems to be rather a mysterious personage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right there, Mr. Bacon, he is. I only wish I was
half as mysterious. Why, he must be worth thousands upon thousands.
And he spends his money like a gentleman, he does&mdash;thinks less
of a sovereign than you think of a bob. He sent Mr. Keyworth a
hundred pounds for his hunt subscription, and said if they were any
ways short at the end of the season they had only to tell him and
he would send as much more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having now got all the information out of Tawney he was able to
give me, I stood him another whiskey, and after lighting a cigar I
mounted my horse and jogged slowly homeward, thinking much about
Mr. Fortescue, and wondering who he could be. The study of
physiognomy is one of my fads, and his face had deeply impressed
me; in great wealth, moreover, there is always something that
strikes the imagination, and this man was evidently very rich, and
the mystery that surrounded him piqued my curiosity.</p>

<h2>Tickle-Me-Quick.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Being naturally of a retiring disposition, and in no sense the
hero of the tale which I am about to tell, I shall say no more
concerning myself than is absolutely necessary. At the same time,
it is essential to a right comprehension of what follows that I say
something about myself, and better that I should say it now than
interrupt the even flow of my narrative later on.</p>
<p>My name is Geoffrey Bacon, and I have reason to believe that I
was born at a place in Essex called (appropriately enough) Dedham.
My family is one of the oldest in the county, and (of course)
highly respectable; but as the question is often put to me by
friends, and will naturally suggest itself to my readers, I may as
well observe, once for all, that I am <em>not</em> a descendent of
the Lord Keeper Bacon, albeit, if he had had any children, I have
no doubt I should have been.</p>
<p>My poor mother died in giving me birth; my father followed her
when I was ten years old, leaving me with his blessing (nothing
else), to the care of his aunt, Miss Ophelia Bacon, by whom I was
brought up and educated. She was very good to me, but though I was
far from being intentionally ungrateful, I fear that I did not
repay her goodness as it deserved. The dear old lady had made up
her mind that I should be a doctor, and though I would rather have
been a farmer or a country gentleman (the latter for choice), I
made no objection; and so long as I remained at school she had no
reason to complain of my conduct. I satisfied my masters and passed
my preliminary examination creditably and without difficulty, to my
aunt&rsquo;s great delight. She protested that she was proud of me,
and rewarded my diligence and cleverness with a five-pound note.
But after I became a student at Guy&rsquo;s I gave her much
trouble, and got myself into some sad scrapes. I spent her present,
and something more, in hiring mounts, for I was passionately fond
of riding, especially to hounds, and ran into debt with a
neighboring livery-stable keeper to the tune of twenty pounds. I
would sometimes borrow the greengrocer&rsquo;s pony, for I was not
particular what I rode, so long as it had four legs. When I could
obtain a mount neither for love nor on credit, I went after the
harriers on foot. The result, as touching my health and growth, was
all that could be desired. As touching my studies, however, it was
less satisfactory. I was spun twice, both in my anatomy and
physiology. Miss Ophelia, though sorely grieved, was very
indulgent, and had she lived, I am afraid that I should never have
got my diploma. But when I was twenty-one and she seventy-five, my
dear aunt died, leaving me all her property (which made an income
of about four hundred a year), with the proviso that unless, within
three years of her death, I obtained the double qualification, the
whole of her estate was to pass to Guy&rsquo;s Hospital. In the
mean time the trustees were empowered to make me an allowance of
two guineas a week and defray all my hospital expenses.</p>
<p>On this, partly because I was loath to lose so goodly a
heritage, partly, I hope, from worthier motives, I buckled-to in
real earnest, and before I was four-and-twenty I could write after
my name the much coveted capitals M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. All this while
I had not once crossed a horse or looked at a hound, yet the ruling
passion was still strong, and being very much of Mr.
Jorrock&rsquo;s opinion that all time not spent in hunting is lost,
I resolved, before &ldquo;settling down&rdquo; or taking up any
position which might be incompatible with indulgence in my favorite
amusement, to devote a few years of my life to fox-hunting. At
twenty-four a man does not give much thought to the future&mdash;at
any rate I did not.</p>
<p>The next question was how to hunt three or four days a week on
four hundred a year, for though I was quite willing to spend my
income, I was resolved not to touch my capital. To begin with, I
sold my aunt&rsquo;s cottage and furniture and took a couple of
rooms for the winter at Red Chimneys, a roomy farm-house in the
neighborhood of Treydon. Then, acting on the great principle of
co-operation, I joined at horse-keeping with my good friend and old
school-fellow, Bertie Alston, a London solicitor. Being both of us
light-weights, we could mount ourselves cheaply; the average cost
of our stud of four horses did not exceed forty pounds apiece.
Moreover, when opportunities offered, we did not disdain to turn an
honest penny by buying an animal cheap and selling him dear, and as
I looked after things myself, bought my own forage, and saw that I
had full measure, our stable expenses were kept within moderate
limits. Except when the weather was bad, or a horse <em>hors de
combat</em>, I generally contrived to get four days&rsquo; hunting
a week&mdash;three with the fox-hounds and one with Mr.
Vigne&rsquo;s harriers&mdash;for, owing to his professional
engagements, Alston could not go out as often as I did. But as I
took all the trouble and responsibility, it was only fair that I
should have the lion&rsquo;s share of the riding.</p>
<p>At the end of the season we either sold the horses off or turned
them into a straw-yard, and I went to sea as ship&rsquo;s surgeon.
In this capacity I made voyages to Australia, to the Cape, and to
the West Indies; and the summer before I first saw Mr. Fortescue I
had been to the Arctic Ocean in a whaler. True, the pay did not
amount to much, but it found me in pocket-money and clothes, and I
saved my keep.</p>
<p>Having now, as I hope, done with digressions and placed myself
<em>en rapport</em> with my readers, I will return to the principal
personage of my story.</p>
<p>The next time I met Mr. Fortescue was at Harlow Bush. He was
quite as well mounted as before, and accompanied, as usual, by
Rawlings and two grooms with their second horses. On this occasion
Mr. Fortescue did not hold himself nearly so much aloof as he had
done at Matching Green, perhaps because he was more noticed; and he
was doubtless more noticed because the fame of his wealth and the
lavish use he made of it were becoming more widely known. The
master gave him a friendly nod and a gracious smile, and expressed
a hope that we should have good sport; the secretary engaged him in
a lively conversation; the hunt servants touched their caps to him
with profound respect, and he received greetings from most of the
swells.</p>
<p>We drew Latton, found in a few minutes, and had a &ldquo;real
good thing,&rdquo; a grand run of nearly two hours, with only one
or two trifling checks, which, as I am not writing a hunting story,
I need not describe any further than to remark that we had plenty
of fencing, a good deal of hard galloping, a kill in the open, and
that of the sixty or seventy who were present at the start only
about a score were up at the finish. Among the fortunate few were
Mr. Fortescue and his pilot. During the latter part of the run we
rode side by side, and pulled up at the same instant, just as the
fox was rolled over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very fine run,&rdquo; I took the liberty to observe, as
I stepped from my saddle and slackened my horse&rsquo;s girths.
&ldquo;It will be a long time before we have a better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hours and two minutes,&rdquo; shouted the secretary,
looking at his watch, &ldquo;and straight. We are in the heart of
the Puckeridge country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Fortescue, quietly, &ldquo;it was a
very enjoyable run. You like hunting, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it! I should rather think I do. I regard fox-hunting
as the very prince of sports. It is manly, health-giving, and
exhilarating. There is no sport in which so many participate and so
heartily enjoy. We enjoy it, the horses enjoy it, and the hounds
enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the fox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the fox! Well, the fox is allowed to exist on
condition of being occasionally hunted. If there were no hunting
there would be no foxes. On the whole, I regard him as a fortunate
and rather pampered individual; and I have even heard it said that
he rather likes being hunted than otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the general question, I dare say you are right.
But I don&rsquo;t think the fox likes it much. It once happened to
me to be hunted, and I know I did not like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was rather startling, and had Mr. Fortescue spoken less
gravely and not been so obviously in earnest, I should have thought
he was joking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;Was it a paper-chase?&rdquo; I
said, rather foolishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it was not a paper-chase,&rdquo; he answered, grimly.
&ldquo;There were no paper-chases in my time. I mean that I was
once hunted, just as we have been hunting that fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a pack of hounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with a pack of hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was about to ask what sort of a chase it was, and how and
where he was hunted, when Cuffe came up, and, on behalf of the
master, offered Mr. Fortescue the brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Fortescue, taking the brush
and handing it to Rawlings. &ldquo;Here is something for
you&rdquo;&mdash;tipping the huntsman a sovereign, which he put in
his pocket with a &ldquo;Thank you kindly, sir,&rdquo; and a
gratified smile.</p>
<p>And then flasks were uncorked, sandwich-cases opened, cigars
lighted, and the conversation becoming general, I had no other
opportunity&mdash;at that time&mdash;of making further inquiry of
Mr. Fortescue touching the singular episode in his career which he
had just mentioned. A few minutes later a move was made for our own
country, and as we were jogging along I found myself near Jim
Rawlings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fresh hoss you&rsquo;ve got, I think,
sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have ridden him two or three times with the
harriers; but this is the first time I have had him out with
fox-hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He carried you very well in the run, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right; he did. Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he lay hold on you at all, Mr. Bacon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light in the mouth, a clever jumper, and a free
goer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s the right sort, he is, sir; and if ever
you feel disposed to sell him, I could, may be, find you a
customer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accepting this as a delicate intimation that Mr. Fortescue had
taken a fancy to the horse and would like to buy him, I told Jim
that I was quite willing to sell at a fair price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what might you consider a fair price, if it is a fair
question?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred guineas,&rdquo; I answered; for, as I knew that
Mr. Fortescue would not &ldquo;look at a horse,&rdquo; as Tawney
put it, under that figure, it would have been useless to ask
less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir. I will speak to my master, and let you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ranger, as I called the horse, was a purchase of Alston&rsquo;s.
Liking his looks (though Bertie was really a very indifferent
judge), he had bought him out of a hansom-cab for forty pounds, and
after a little &ldquo;schooling,&rdquo; the creature took to
jumping as naturally as a duck takes to water. Sixty pounds may
seem rather an unconscionable profit, but considering that Ranger
was quite sound and up to weight, I don&rsquo;t think a hundred
guineas was too much. A dealer would have asked a hundred and
fifty.</p>
<p>At any rate, Mr. Fortescue did not think it too much, for
Rawlings presently brought me word that his master would take the
horse at the price I had named, if I could warrant him sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case it is a bargain,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for I
can warrant him sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir. I&rsquo;ll send one of the grooms over to
your place for him to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly afterward I fell in with Keyworth, and as a matter of
course we talked about Mr. Fortescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. I believe he is rich&mdash;and
respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is pretty evident, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure. A man who spends a good deal of money is
presumably rich; but it by no means follows that he is respectable.
There are such people in the world as successful rogues and wealthy
swindlers. Not that I think Mr. Fortescue is either one or the
other. I learned, from the check he sent me for his subscription,
who his bankers are, and through a friend of mine, who is intimate
with one of the directors, I got a confidential report about him.
It does not amount to much; but it is satisfactory so far as it
goes. They say he is a man of large fortune, and, as they believe,
highly respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All there was in the report. But
Tomlinson&mdash;that&rsquo;s my friend&mdash;has heard that he has
spent the greater part of his life abroad, and that he made his
money in South America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mention of South America interested me, for I had made
voyages both to Rio de Janeiro and several places on the Spanish
Main.</p>
<p>&ldquo;South America is rather vague,&rdquo; I observed.
&ldquo;You might almost as well say &lsquo;Southern Asia.&rsquo;
Have you any idea in what part of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least. I have told you all I know. I should be
glad to know more; but for the present it is quite enough for my
purpose. I intend to call upon Mr. Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to say that I had no such intention, for
having neither a &ldquo;position in the county,&rdquo; as the
phrase goes, a house of my own, nor any official connection with
the hunt, a call from me would probably have been regarded, and
rightly so, as a piece of presumption. As it happened, however, I
not only called on Mr. Fortescue before the secretary, but became
his guest, greatly to my surprise, and, I have no doubt, to his,
although he was the indirect cause; for had he not bought Ranger,
it is very unlikely that I should have become an inmate of his
house.</p>
<p>It came about in this way. Bertie was so pleased with the result
of his first speculation in horseflesh (though so far as he was
concerned it was a pure fluke) that he must needs make another. If
he had picked up a second cab-horse at thirty or forty pounds he
could not have gone far wrong; but instead of that he must needs go
to Tattersall&rsquo;s and give nearly fifty for a blood mare
rejoicing in the name of &ldquo;Tickle-me-Quick,&rdquo; described
as being &ldquo;the property of a gentleman,&rdquo; and said to
have won several country steeple-chases.</p>
<p>The moment I set eyes on the beast I saw she was a screw,
&ldquo;and vicious at that,&rdquo; as an American would have said.
But as she had been bought (without warranty) and paid for, I had
to make the best of her. Within an hour of the mare&rsquo;s arrival
at Red Chimneys, I was on her back, trying her paces. She galloped
well and jumped splendidly, but I feared from her ways that she
would be hot with hounds, and perhaps, kick in a crowd, one of the
worst faults that a hunter can possess.</p>
<p>On the next non-hunting day I took Tickle-me-Quick out for a
long ride in the country, to see how she shaped as a hack. I little
thought, as we set off, that it would prove to be her last journey,
and one of the most memorable events of my life.</p>
<p>For a while all went well. The mare wanted riding, yet she
behaved no worse than I expected, although from the way she laid
her ears back and the angry tossing of her head when I made her
feel the bit, she was clearly not in the best of tempers. But I
kept her going; and an hour after leaving Red Chimneys we turned
into a narrow deep lane between high banks, which led to Kingscote
entering the road on the west side of the park at right angles, and
very near Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s lodge-gates.</p>
<p>In the field to my right several colts were grazing, and when
they caught sight of Tickle-me-Quick trotting up the lane they took
it into their heads to have an impromptu race among themselves.
Neighing loudly, they set off at full gallop. Without asking my
leave, Tickle-me-Quick followed suit. I tried to stop her. I might
as well have tried to stop an avalanche. So, making a virtue of
necessity, I let her go, thinking that before she reached the top
of the lane she would have had quite enough, and I should be able
to pull her up without difficulty.</p>
<p>The colts are soon left behind; but we can hear them galloping
behind us, and on goes the mare like the wind. I can now see the
end of the lane, and as the great park wall, twelve feet high,
looms in sight, the horrible thought flashes on my mind that unless
I pull her up we shall both be dashed to pieces; for to turn a
sharp corner at the speed we are going is quite out of the
question.</p>
<p>I make another effort, sawing the mare&rsquo;s mouth till it
bleeds, and tightening the reins till they are fit to break.</p>
<p>All in vain; she puts her head down and gallops on, if possible
more madly than before. Still larger looms that terrible wall;
death stares me in the face, and for the first time in my life I
undergo the intense agony of mortal terror.</p>
<p>We are now at the end of the lane. There is one chance only, and
that the most desperate, of saving my life. I slip my feet from the
stirrups, and when Tickle-me-Quick is within two or three strides
of the wall, I drop the reins and throw myself from her back. Then
all is darkness.</p>

<h2>Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s Proposal.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel as if I were in a strait-jacket. One of my arms is
immovable, my head is bandaged, and when I try to turn I suffer
excruciating pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have wakened up!&rdquo; says somebody with a
foreign accent, and a dark face bends over me. The light is dim and
my sight weak, and but for his grizzled mustache I might have taken
the speaker for a woman, his ears being adorned with large gold
rings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you? You are in the house of Se&ntilde;or
Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the mare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mare broke her wicked head against the park wall, and
she has gone to the kennels to be eaten by the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already? How long is it since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the day before yesterday zat it
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless me! I must have been insensible ever since.
That means concussion of the brain. Am I much damaged otherwise, do
you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well. Your left shoulder is dislocated, one of
your fingers and two of your ribs broken, and one of your ankles
severely contused. But it might have been worse. If you had not
thrown yourself from your horse, as you did, you would just now be
in a coffin instead of in this comfortable bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody saw me, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the lodge-keeper. He thought you were dead, and came
up and told us; and we brought you here on a stretcher, and the
Se&ntilde;or Coronel sent for a doctor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Se&ntilde;or Coronel! Do you mean Mr.
Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I mean Mr. Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are Ramon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Hijo de Dios!</em> You know my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s
body-servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caramba! Somebody must have told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have made a worse guess, Se&ntilde;or Ramon.
Will you please tell Mr. Fortescue that I thank him with all my
heart for his great kindness, and that I will not trespass on it
more than I can possibly help. As soon as I can be moved I shall go
to my own place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will not be for a long time, and I do not think the
Se&ntilde;or Coronel would like&mdash;But when he returns he will
see you, and then you can tell him yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is away from home, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Se&ntilde;or Coronel has gone to London. He will be
back to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I cannot thank him to-day, I can thank you. You
are my nurse, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little&mdash;Geist and I, and Mees Tomleenson, we
relieve each other. But those two don&rsquo;t know much about
wounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Hijo de Dios!</em> Do I know much about wounds? I
have nursed men who have been cut to pieces. I have been cut to
pieces myself. Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that Ramon pointed to his neck, which was seamed all
the way down with a tremendous scar; then to his left hand, which
was minus two fingers; next to one of his arms, which appeared to
have been plowed from wrist to elbow with a bullet; and lastly to
his head, which was almost covered with cicatrices, great and
small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have many more marks in other parts of my body,
which it would not be convenient to show you just now,&rdquo; he
said, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an old soldier, then, Ramon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very. And now I will light myself a cigarette, and you
will no more talk. As an old soldier, I know that it is bad for a
<em>caballero</em> with a broken head to talk so much as you are
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a surgeon, I know you are right, and I will talk no
more for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, feeling rather drowsy, I composed myself to sleep. The
last thing I remembered before closing my eyes was the long,
swarthy, quixotic-looking face of my singular nurse, veiled in a
blue cloud of cigarette-smoke, which, as it rolled from the
nostrils of his big, aquiline nose, made those orifices look like
the twin craters of an active volcano, upside down.</p>
<p>When, after a short snooze, I woke a second time, my first
sensation was one of intense surprise, and being unable, without
considerable inconvenience, to rub my eyes, I winked several times
in succession to make sure that I was not dreaming; for while I
slept the swart visage, black eyes, and grizzled mustache of my
nurse had, to all appearance, been turned into a fair countenance,
with blue eyes and a tawny head, while the tiny cigarette had
become a big meerschaum pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless me! You are surely not Ramon?&rdquo; I
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am Geist. It is my turn of duty as your nurse. Can
I get you anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much; you are all very kind. I feel rather
faint, and perhaps if I had something to eat it might do me
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. There is some beef-tea ready. Here it is.
Shall I feed you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. My left arm is tied up, and this broken finger
is very painful. Bat I am giving you no end of trouble. I
don&rsquo;t know how I shall be able to repay you and Mr. Fortescue
for all your kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ach Gott!</em> Don&rsquo;t mention it, my dear sir.
Mr. Fortescue said you were to have every attention; and when a
fellow-man has been broken all to pieces it is our duty to do for
him what we can. Who knows? Perhaps some time I may be broken all
to pieces myself. But I will not ride your fiery horses. My weight
is seventeen stone, and if I was to throw myself off a galloping
horse as you did, <em>ach Gott!</em> I should be broken past
mending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Geist made an attentive and genial nurse, discoursing so
pleasantly and fluently that, greatly to my satisfaction (for I was
very weak), my part in the conversation was limited to an
occasional monosyllable; but he said nothing on the subject as to
which I was most anxious for information&mdash;Mr.
Fortescue&mdash;and, as he clearly desired to avoid it, I refrained
from asking questions that might have put him in a difficulty and
exposed me to a rebuff.</p>
<p>I found out afterward that neither he nor Ramon ever discussed
their master, and though Mrs. Tomlinson, my third nurse (a buxom,
healthy, middle-aged widow, whose position seemed to be something
between that of housekeeper and upper servant), was less reticent,
it was probably because she had so little to tell.</p>
<p>I learned, among other things, that the habits of the household
were almost as regular as those of a regiment, and that the
servants, albeit kindly treated and well paid, were strictly ruled,
even comparatively slight breaches of discipline being punished
with instant dismissal. At half-past ten everybody was supposed to
be in bed, and up at six; for at seven Mr. Fortescue took his first
breakfast of fruit and dry toast. According to Mrs. Tomlinson (and
this I confess rather surprised me) he was an essentially busy man.
His only idle time was that which he gave to sleep. During his
waking hours he was always either working in his study, his
laboratory, or his conservatories, riding and driving being his
sole recreations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the most active man I ever knew, young or
old,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tomlinson, &ldquo;and a good master&mdash;I
will say that for him. But I cannot make him out at all. He seems
to have neither kith nor kin, and yet&mdash;This is quite between
ourselves, Mr. Bacon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mrs. Tomlinson, quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is a picture in his room as he keeps veiled
and locked up in a sort of shrine; but one day he forgot to turn
the key, and I&mdash;I looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally. And what did you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The picture of a woman, dark, but, oh, so
beautiful&mdash;as beautiful as an angel&hellip;. I thought it was,
may be, a sweetheart or something, but she is too young for the
likes of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portraits are always the same; that picture may have been
painted ages ago. Always veiled is it? That seems very mysterious,
does it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does; and I am just dying to know what the mystery is.
If you should happen to find out, and it&rsquo;s no secret, would
you mind telling me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Herr Geist appeared, whereupon Mrs. Tomlinson,
with true feminine tact, changed the subject without waiting for a
reply.</p>
<p>During the time I was laid up Mr. Fortescue came into my room
almost every day, but never stayed more than a few minutes. When I
expressed my sense of his kindness and talked about going home, he
would smile gravely, and say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience! You must be my guest until you have the full
use of your limbs and are able to go about without help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this I protested no more, for there was an indescribable
something about Mr. Fortescue which would have made it difficult to
contradict him, even had I been disposed to take so ungrateful and
ungracious a part.</p>
<p>At length, after a weary interval of inaction and pain, came a
time when I could get up and move about without discomfort, and one
fine frosty day, which seemed the brightest of my life, Geist and
Ramon helped me down-stairs and led me into a pretty little
morning-room, opening into one of the conservatories, where the
plants and flowers had been so arranged as to look like a sort of
tropical forest, in the midst of which was an aviary filled with
parrots, cockatoos, and other birds of brilliant plumage.</p>
<p>Geist brought me an easy-chair, Ramon a box of cigarettes and
the &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; and I was just settling down to a
comfortable read and smoke, when Mr. Fortescue entered from the
conservatory. He wore a Norfolk jacket and a broad-brimmed hat, and
his step was so elastic, and his bearing so upright, and he seemed
so strong and vigorous withal, that I began to think that in
estimating his age at sixty I had made a mistake. He looked more
like fifty or fifty-five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you down-stairs,&rdquo; he said, helping
himself to a cigarette. &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much better, thank you, and to-morrow or the next
day I must really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I cannot let you go yet. I shall keep you, at any
rate, a few days longer. And while this frost lasts you can do no
hunting. How is the shoulder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better. In a fortnight or so I shall be able to dispense
with the sling, but my ankle is the worst. The contusion was very
severe. I fear that I shall feel the effects of it for a long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very likely, I think. I would any time rather
have a clean flesh wound than a severe contusion. I have had
experience of both. At Salamanca my shoulder was laid open with a
sabre-stroke at the very moment my horse was shot under me; and my
leg, which was terribly bruised in the fall, was much longer in
getting better than my shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Salamanca! You surely don&rsquo;t mean the battle of
Salamanca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the battle of Salamanca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, God bless me, that is ages ago! At the beginning of
the century&mdash;1810 or 1812, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle of Salamanca was fought on the 21st of July,
1812,&rdquo; said my host, with a matter-of-fact air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;why&mdash;how?&rdquo; I stammered, staring at
him in supreme surprise. &ldquo;That is sixty years since, and you
don&rsquo;t look much more than fifty now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same I am nearly fourscore,&rdquo; said Mr.
Fortescue, smiling as if the compliment pleased him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourscore, and so hale and strong! I have known men half
your age not half so vigorous and alert. Why, you may live to be a
hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall, probably longer. Of course barring
accidents, and if I continue to avoid a peril which has been
hanging over me for half a century or so, and from which I have
several times escaped only by the skin of my teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the peril, Mr. Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assassination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assassination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, assassination. I told you a short time ago that I
was once hunted by a pack of hounds. I am hunted now&mdash;have
been hunted for two generations&mdash;by a family of
murderers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought occurred to me&mdash;and not for the first
time&mdash;that Mr. Fortescue was either mad or a Munchausen, and I
looked at him curiously; but neither in that calm, powerful,
self-possessed face, nor in the steady gaze of those keen dark
eyes, could I detect the least sign of incipient insanity or a
boastful spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite mistaken,&rdquo; he said, with one of his
enigmatic smiles. &ldquo;I am not mad; and I have lived too long
either to cherish illusions or conjure up imaginary
dangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, Mr. Fortescue&mdash;I had no
intention,&rdquo; I stammered, quite taken aback by the accuracy
with which he had read, or guessed, my thoughts&mdash;&ldquo;I had
no intention to cast a doubt on what you said. But who are these
people that seek your life? and why don&rsquo;t you inform the
police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police! How could the police help me?&rdquo;
exclaimed Mr. Fortescue, with a gesture of disdain, &ldquo;Besides,
life would not be worth having at the price of being always under
police protection, like an evicting Irish landlord. But let us
change the subject; we have talked quite enough about myself. I
want to talk about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very few minutes sufficed to put Mr. Fortescue in possession
of all the information he desired. He already knew something about
me, and as I had nothing to conceal, I answered all his questions
without reserve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you are rather wasting your
life?&rdquo; he asked, after I had answered the last of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am enjoying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely. People generally do enjoy life when they are
young. Hunting is all very well as an amusement, but to have no
other object in life seems&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;just a
little frivolous, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it does; but I mean, after a while, to buy
a practice and settle down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the mean time your medical knowledge must be
growing rather rusty. I have heard physicians say that it is only
after they have obtained their degree that they begin to learn
their profession. And the practice you get on board these ships
cannot amount to much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; I said, frankly, for my
conscience was touched. &ldquo;I am, as you say, living too much
for the present. I know less than I knew when I left Guy&rsquo;s. I
could not pass my &lsquo;final&rsquo; over again to save my life.
You are quite right: I must turn over a new leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so, the more especially as I
have a proposal to make; and as I make it quite as much in my own
interest as in yours, you will incur no obligation in accepting it.
I want you to become an inmate of my house, help me in my
laboratory, and act as my secretary and domestic physician, and
when I am away from home, as my representative. You will have free
quarters, of course; my stable will be at your disposal for hunting
purposes, and you may go sometimes to London to attend lectures and
do practical work at your hospital. As for salary&mdash;you can fix
it yourself, when you have ascertained by actual experience the
character of your work. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fortescue put this question as if he had no doubt about my
answer, and I fulfilled his expectation by answering promptly in
the affirmative. The proposal seemed in every way to my advantage,
and was altogether to my liking; and even had it been less so I
should have accepted it, for what I had just heard greatly whetted
my curiosity, and made me more desirous than ever to know the
history of the extraordinary man with whom I had so strangely come
in contact, and ascertain the secret of his wealth.</p>
<p>The same day I wrote to Alston announcing the dissolution of our
partnership, and leaving him to deal with the horses at Red
Chimneys as he might think fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_IV" id="Ch_IV">Chapter IV.</a></h3>
<h2>A Rescue.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>My curiosity was rather long in being gratified, and but for a
very strange occurrence, which I shall presently describe, probably
never would have been gratified. Even after I had been a member of
Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s household for several months, I knew little
more of his antecedents and circumstances than on the day when he
made me the proposal which I have just mentioned. If I attempted to
lead up to the subject, he would either cleverly evade it or say
bluntly that he preferred to talk about something else. Save as to
matters that did not particularly interest me, Ramon was as
reticent as his master; and as Geist had only been with Mr.
Fortescue during the latter&rsquo;s residence at Kingscote, his
knowledge, or, rather, his ignorance was on a par with my own.</p>
<p>Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s character was as enigmatic as his history
was obscure. He seemed to be destitute both of kinsfolk and
friends, never made any allusion to his family, neither noticed
women nor discussed them. Politics and religion he equally ignored,
and, so far as might appear, had neither foibles nor fads. On the
other hand, he had three passions&mdash;science, horses, and
horticulture, and his knowledge was almost encyclop&aelig;dic. He
was a great reader, master of many languages, and seemed to have
been everywhere and seen all in the world that was worth seeing.
His wealth appeared to be unlimited, but how he made it or where he
kept it I had no idea. All I knew was that whenever money was
wanted it was forthcoming, and that he signed a check for ten
pounds and ten thousand with equal indifference. As he conducted
his private correspondence himself, my position as secretary gave
me no insight into his affairs. My duties consisted chiefly in
corresponding with tradesmen, horse-dealers, and nursery gardeners,
and noting the results of chemical experiments.</p>
<p>Mr. Fortescue was very abstemious, and took great care of his
health, and if he was really verging on eighty (which I very much
doubted), I thought he might not improbably live to be a hundred
and ten and even a hundred and twenty. He drank nothing, whatever,
neither tea, coffee, cocoa, nor any other beverage, neither water
nor wine, always quenching his thirst with fruit, of which he ate
largely. So far as I knew, the only liquid that ever passed his
lips was an occasional liquor-glass of a mysterious decoction which
he prepared himself and kept always under lock and key. His
breakfast, which he took every morning at seven, consisted of bread
and fruit.</p>
<p>He ate very little animal food, limiting himself for the most
part to fish and fowl, and invariably spent eight or nine hours of
the twenty-four in bed. We often discussed physiology,
therapeutics, and kindred subjects, of which his knowledge was so
extensive as to make me suspect that some time in his life he had
belonged to the medical profession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best physicians I ever met,&rdquo; he once observed,
&ldquo;are the Callavayas of the Andes&mdash;if the preservation
and prolongation of human life is the test of medical skill. Among
the Callavayas the period of youth is thirty years; a man is not
held to be a man until he reaches fifty, and he only begins to be
old at a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it among the Callavayas that you learned the secret
of long life, Mr. Fortescue?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he answered, with one of his peculiar
smiles; and then he started me by saying that he would never be a
&ldquo;lean and slippered pantaloon.&rdquo; When health and
strength failed him he should cease to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t mean that you will commit
suicide?&rdquo; I exclaimed, in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may call it what you like. I shall do as the Fiji
Islanders and some tribes of Indians do, in similar
circumstances&mdash;retire to a corner and still the beatings of my
heart by an effort of will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is that possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen it done, and I have done it myself&mdash;not,
of course, to the point of death, but so far as to simulate death.
I once saved my life in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that when you were hunted, Mr. Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was not. Let us go to the stables. I want to see
you ride Regina over the jumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fortescue had caused to be arranged in the park a miniature
steeple-chase course about a mile round, on which newly-acquired
hunters were always tried, and the old ones regularly exercised. He
generally made a point of being present on these occasions,
sometimes riding over the course himself. If a horse, bought as a
hunter, failed to justify its character by its performance it was
invariably returned.</p>
<p>Sometimes Ramon gave us an exhibition of his skill as a gaucho.
One of the wildest of the horses would be let loose in the park,
and the old soldier, armed with a lasso and mounted on an animal
trained by himself, and equipped with a South American saddle,
would follow and try to &ldquo;rope&rdquo; the runaway, Mr.
Fortescue, Rawlings, and myself riding after him. It was
&ldquo;good fun,&rdquo; but I fancy Mr. Fortescue regarded this
sport, as he regarded hunting, less as an amusement than as a means
of keeping him in good health and condition.</p>
<p>Regina (a recent purchase) was tried and, I think, found
wanting. I recall the instance merely because it is associated in
my mind with an event which, besides affecting a momentous change
in my relations with Mr. Fortescue and greatly influencing my own
fortune, rendered possible the writing of this book.</p>
<p>The trial over, Mr. Fortescue told me, somewhat abruptly, that
he intended to leave home in an hour, and should be away for
several days. As he walked toward the house, I inquired if there
was anything he would like me to look after during his absence,
whereupon he mentioned several chemical and electrical experiments,
which he wished me to continue and note the results. He requested
me, further, to open all letters&mdash;save such as were marked
private or bore foreign postmarks&mdash;and answer so many of them
as, without his instructions, I might be able to do. For the rest,
I was to exercise a general supervision, especially over the
stables and gardens. As for purely domestic concerns, Geist was so
excellent a manager that his master trusted him without
reserve.</p>
<p>When Mr. Fortescue came down-stairs, equipped for his journey, I
inquired when he expected to return, and on what day he would like
the carriage to meet him at the station. I thought he might tell me
where he was going; but he did not take the hint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it rains I will telegraph,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if
fine, I shall probably walk; it is only a couple of
miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fortescue, as he always did when he went outside his park
(unless he was mounted), took with him a sword-stick, a habit which
I thought rather ridiculous, for, though he was an essentially sane
man, I had quite made up my mind that his fear of assassination was
either a fancy or a fad.</p>
<p>After my patron&rsquo;s departure I worked for a while in the
laboratory; and an hour before dinner I went for a stroll in the
park, making, for no reason in particular, toward the principal
entrance. As I neared it I heard voices in dispute, and on reaching
the gates I found the lodge-keeper engaged in a somewhat warm
altercation with an Italian organ-grinder and another fellow of the
same kidney, who seemed to be his companion.</p>
<p>The lodge-keepers had strict orders to exclude from the park all
beggars without exception, and all and sundry who produced music by
turning a handle. Real musicians, however, were freely admitted,
and often generously rewarded.</p>
<p>The lodge-keeper in question (an old fellow with a wooden leg)
had not been able to make the two vagabonds in question understand
this. They insisted on coming in, and the lodge-keeper said that if
I had not appeared he verily believed they would have entered in
spite of him. They seemed to know very little English; but as I
knew a little Italian, which I eked out with a few significant
gestures, I speedily enlightened them, and they sheered off,
looking daggers, and muttering what sounded like curses.</p>
<p>The man who carried the organ was of the usual type&mdash;short,
thick-set, hairy, and unwashed. His companion, rather to my
surprise, was just the reverse&mdash;tall, shapely, well set up,
and comparatively well clad; and with his dark eyes, black
mustache, broad-brimmed hat, and red tie loosely knotted round his
brawny throat, he looked decidedly picturesque.</p>
<p>On the following day, as I was going to the stables (which were
a few hundred yards below the house) I found my picturesque Italian
in the back garden, singing a barcarole to the accompaniment of a
guitar. But as he had complied with the condition of which I had
informed him, I made no objection. So far from that I gave him a
shilling, and as the maids (who were greatly taken with his
appearance) got up a collection for him and gave him a feed, he did
not do badly.</p>
<p>A few days later, while out riding, I called at the station for
an evening paper, and there he was again, &ldquo;touching his
guitar,&rdquo; and singing something that sounded very
sentimental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow is like a bad shilling,&rdquo; I said to one
of the porters&mdash;&ldquo;always turning up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is never away. I think he must have taken it into his
head to live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he just hangs about, and watches the trains, as if he
had never seen any before. I suppose there are none in the country
he comes from. Between whiles he sometimes plays on his banjo and
sings a bit for us. I cannot quite make him out; but as he is very
quiet and well-behaved, and never interferes with nobody, it is no
business of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither was it any business of mine; so after buying my paper I
dismissed the subject from my mind and rode on to Kingscote.</p>
<p>As a rule, I found the morning papers quite as much as I could
struggle with; but at this time a poisoning case was being tried
which interested me so much that while it lasted I sent for or
fetched an evening paper every afternoon. The day after my
conversation with the porter I adopted the former course, the day
after that I adopted the latter, and, contrary to my usual
practice, I walked.</p>
<p>There were two ways from Kingscote to the station; one by the
road, the other by a little-used footpath. I went by the road, and
as I was buying my paper at Smith&rsquo;s bookstall the
station-master told me that Mr. Fortescue had returned by a train
which came in about ten minutes previously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be walking home by the fields, then, or we should
have met,&rdquo; I said; and pocketing my paper, I set off with the
intention of overtaking him.</p>
<p>As I have already observed, the field way was little frequented,
most people preferring the high-road as being equally direct and,
except in the height of summer, both dryer and less lonesome.</p>
<p>After traversing two or three fields the foot-path ran through a
thick wood, once part of the great forest of Essex, then descending
into a deep hollow, it made a sudden bend and crossed a rambling
old brook by a dilapidated bridge.</p>
<p>As I reached the bend I heard a shout, and looking down I saw
what at first sight (the day being on the wane and the wood gloomy)
I took to be three men amusing themselves with a little
cudgel-play. But a second glance showed me that something much more
like murder than cudgel-play was going on; and shortening my Irish
blackthorn, I rushed at breakneck speed down the hollow.</p>
<p>I was just in time. Mr. Fortescue, with his back against the
tree, was defending himself with his sword-stick against the two
Italians, each of whom, armed with a long dagger, was doing his
best to get at him without falling foul of the sword.</p>
<p>The rascals were so intent on their murderous business that they
neither heard nor saw me, and, taking them in the rear, I fetched
the guitar-player a crack on his skull that stretched him senseless
on the ground, whereupon the other villain, without more ado, took
to his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Fortescue, quietly, as he put
up his weapon. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could have kept the
brigands at bay much longer. A sword-stick is no match for a pair
of Corsican daggers. The next time I take a walk I must have a
revolver. Is that fellow dead, do you think? If he is, I shall be
still more in your debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the prostrate man&rsquo;s face, then at his head.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there is no fracture. He is only
stunned.&rdquo; My diagnosis was verified almost as soon as it was
spoken. The next moment the Italian opened his eyes and sat up, and
had I not threatened him with my blackthorn would have sprung to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to thank this gentleman for saving your
life,&rdquo; said Mr. Fortescue, in French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the fellow in the same language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had killed me you would have been hanged. If I
hand you over to the police you will get twenty years at the hulks
for attempted murder, and unless you answer my questions truly I
shall hand you over to the police. You are a Griscelli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Giuseppe, the son of Giuseppe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case you are <em>his</em> grandson. How did you
find me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were at Paris last summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did not see me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but Giacomo did; and from your name and appearance we
felt sure you were the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Giacomo&mdash;your brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my cousin, the son of Luigi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He belongs to the secret police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Giacomo put you on the scent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. He ascertained that you were living in England.
The rest was easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was, was it? You don&rsquo;t find yourself very
much at ease just now, I fancy. And now, my young friend, I am
going to treat you better than you deserve. I can afford to do so,
for, as you see, and, as your grandfather and your father
discovered to their cost, I bear a charmed life. You cannot kill
me. You may go. And I advise you to return to France or Corsica, or
wherever may be your home, with all speed, for to-morrow I shall
denounce you to the police, and if you are caught you know what to
expect. Who is your accomplice&mdash;a kinsman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only compatriot, whose acquaintance I made in London.
He is a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently. One more question and I have done. Have you
any brothers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about a dozen cousins, I suppose, all of whom would
be delighted to murder me&mdash;if they could. Now, give that
gentleman your dagger, and march, <em>au pas
gymnastique</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a very ill grace, Giuseppe Griscelli did as he was bid, and
then, rising to his feet, he marched, not, however, at the <em>pas
gymnastique</em>, but slowly and deliberately; and as he reached a
bend in the path a few yards farther on, he turned round and cast
at Mr. Fortescue the most diabolically ferocious glance I ever saw
on a human countenance.</p>

<h2>Thereby Hangs a Tale.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe now, I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Fortescue, as we
walked homeward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe what, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I have relentless enemies who seek my life. When I
first told you of this you did not believe me. You thought I was
the victim of an hallucination, else had I been more frank with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t protest! I cannot blame you. It is hard for
people who have led uneventful lives and seen little of the seamy
side of human nature to believe that under the veneer of
civilization and the mask of convention, hatreds are still as
fierce, men still as revengeful as ever they were in olden
times&hellip;. I hope I did not make a mistake in sparing young
Griscelli&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sparing his life! How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sought my life, and I had a perfect right to take
his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not a very Christian sentiment, Mr.
Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say it was. Do you always repay good for evil
and turn your check to the smiter, Mr. Bacon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you put it in that way, I fear I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anybody who does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s reflection I was again compelled to
answer in the negative. I could not call to mind a single
individual of my acquaintance who acted on the principle of
returning good for evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, if I am no better than other people, I am no
worse. Yet, after all, I think I did well to let him go. Had I
killed the brigand, there would have been a coroner&rsquo;s
inquest, and questions asked which might have been troublesome to
answer, and he has brothers and cousins. If I could destroy the
entire brood! Did you see the look he gave me as he went away? It
meant murder. We have not seen the last of Giuseppe Griscelli, Mr.
Bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid we have not. I never saw such an expression
of intense hatred in my life! Has he cause for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say he thinks so. I killed his father and his
grand-father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, uttered as indifferently as if it were a question of
killing hares and foxes, was more than I could stand. I am not
strait-laced, but I draw the line at murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did what?&rdquo; I exclaimed, as, horror-struck and
indignant, I stopped in the path and looked him full in the
face.</p>
<p>I thought I had never seen him so Mephistopheles-like. A
sinister smile parted his lips, showing his small white teeth
gleaming under his gray mustache, and he regarded me with a look of
cynical amusement, in which there was perhaps a slight touch of
contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a young man, Mr. Bacon,&rdquo; he observed,
gently, &ldquo;and, like most young men, and a great many old men,
you make false deductions. Killing is not always murder. If it
were, we should consign our conquerors to everlasting infamy,
instead of crowning them with laurels and erecting statues to their
memory. I am no murderer, Mr. Bacon. At the same time I do not
cherish illusions. Unpremeditated murder is by no means the worst
of crimes. Taking a life is only anticipating the inevitable; and
of all murderers, Nature is the greatest and the cruellest. I
have&mdash;if I could only tell you&mdash;make you see what I have
seen&mdash;Even now, O God! though half a century has run its
course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s voice failed him; he turned deadly
pale, and his countenance took an expression of the keenest
anguish. But the signs of emotion passed away as quickly as they
had appeared. Another moment and he had fully regained his
composure, and he added, in his usual self-possessed manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this must seem very strange to you, Mr. Bacon. I
suppose you consider me somewhat of a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not somewhat, but very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fortescue smiled (he never laughed) and reflected a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how strangely
things come about, and, so to speak, hang together. The greatest of
all mysteries is fate. If that horse had not run away with you,
these rascals would almost certainly have made away with me; and
the incident of to-day is one of the consequences of that which I
mentioned at our first interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we had that good run from Latton. I remember it very
well. You said you had been hunted yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it, Mr. Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Thereby hangs a tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it me, Mr. Fortescue,&rdquo; I said, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a very long tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better; it is sure to be
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I dare say you would find it interesting. My
life has been stirring and stormy enough, in all
conscience&mdash;except for the ten years I spent in heaven,&rdquo;
said Mr. Fortescue, in a voice and with a look of intense
sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years in heaven!&rdquo; I exclaimed, as much
astonished as I had just been horrified. Was the man mad, after
all, or did he speak in paradoxes? &ldquo;Ten years in
heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fortescue smiled again, and then it occurred to me that his
ten years of heaven might have some connection with the veiled
portrait and the shrine in his room up-stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take me too literally,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I spoke
metaphorically. I did not mean that, like Swedenborg and Mohammed,
I have made excursions to Paradise. I merely meant that I once
spent ten years of such serene happiness as it seldom falls to the
lot of man to enjoy. But to return to our subject. You would like
to know more of my past; but as it would not be satisfactory to
tell you an incomplete history, and to tell you all&mdash;Yet why
not? I have done nothing that I am ashamed of; and it is well you
should know something of the man whose life you have saved once,
and may possibly save again. You are trustworthy, straightforward,
and vigilant, and albeit you are not overburdened with
intelligence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Fortescue paused, as if to reflect; and, though the
observation was not very flattering&mdash;hardly civil,
indeed&mdash;I was so anxious to hear this story that I took it in
good part, and waited patiently for his decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To relate it <em>viva voce</em>&rdquo; he went on,
thoughtfully, &ldquo;would be troublesome to both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I should find it anything but
troublesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should. It would take too much time, and I hate
travelling over old ground. But that is a difficulty which I think
we can get over. For many years I have made a record of the
principal events of my life, in the form of a personal narrative;
and though I have sometimes let it run behind for a while, I have
always written it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly the thing. As you say, telling a long
story is troublesome. I can read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not. It is written in a sort of stenographic
cipher of my own invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very awkward,&rdquo; I said, despondently.
&ldquo;I know no more of shorthand than of Sanskrit, and though I
once tried to make out a cipher, the only tangible result was a
splitting headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the key, which I will give you, a little instruction
and practice, you should have no difficulty in making out my
cipher. It will be an exercise for your
intelligence&rdquo;&mdash;smiling. &ldquo;Will you try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My very best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for the conditions. In the first place, you must,
in stenographic phrase, &lsquo;extend&rsquo; my notes, write out
the narrative in a legible hand and good English. If there be any
blanks, I will fill them up; if you require explanations, I will
give them. Do you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second condition is that you neither make use of the
narrative for any purpose of your own, nor disclose the whole or
any part of it to anybody until and unless I give you leave. What
say you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third and last condition is, that you engage to stay
with me in your present capacity until it pleases me to give you
your <em>cong&eacute;</em>. Again what say you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was rather a &ldquo;big order,&rdquo; and very one-sided.
It bound me to remain with Mr. Fortescue for an indefinite period,
yet left him at liberty to dismiss me at a moment&rsquo;s notice;
and if he went on living, I might have to stay at Kingscote till I
was old and gray. All the same, the position was a good one. I had
four hundred a year (the price at which I had modestly appraised my
services), free quarters, a pleasant life, and lots of
hunting&mdash;all I could wish for, in fact; and what can a man
have more? So again I said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are agreed in all points, then. If you will come into
my room &ldquo;&mdash;we were by this time arrived at the
house&mdash;&ldquo;you shall have your first lesson in
cryptography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assented with eagerness, for I was burning to begin, and, from
what Mr. Fortescue had said, I did not anticipate any great
difficulty in making out the cipher.</p>
<p>But when he produced a specimen page of his manuscript, my
confidence, like Bob Acre&rsquo;s courage, oozed out at my
finger-ends, or rather, all over me, for I broke out into a cold
sweat.</p>
<p>The first few lines resembled a confused array of algebraic
formula. (I detest algebra.) Then came several lines that seemed to
have been made by the crawlings of tipsy flies with inky legs,
followed by half a dozen or so that looked like the ravings of a
lunatic done into Welsh, while the remainder consisted of Roman
numerals and ordinary figures mixed up, higgledy-piggledy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is nothing less than appalling,&rdquo; I almost
groaned. &ldquo;It will take me longer to learn than two or three
languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! When you have got the clew, and learned the
signs, you will read the cipher with ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely; but when will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon. The system is not nearly so complicated as it
looks, and the language being English&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;English! It looks like a mixture of ancient Mexican and
modern Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The language being English, nothing could be easier for a
man of ordinary intelligence. If I had expected that my manuscript
would fall into the hands of a cryptographist, I should have
contrived something much more complicated and written it in several
languages; and you have the key ready to your hand. Come, let us
begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After half an hour&rsquo;s instruction I began to see daylight,
and to feel that with patience and practice I should be able to
write out the story in legible English. The little I had read with
Mr. Fortescue made me keen to know more; but as the cryptographic
narrative did not begin at the beginning, he proposed that I should
write this, as also any other missing parts, to his dictation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows that you may not make a book of it?&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I am intelligent Enough?&rdquo; I asked,
resentfully; for his uncomplimentary references to my mental
capacity were still rankling in my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hope so. Everybody writes in these days.
Don&rsquo;t worry yourself on that score, my dear Mr. Bacon. Even
though you may write a book, nobody will accuse you of being
exceptionally intelligent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot make a book of your narrative without your
leave,&rdquo; I observed, with a painful sense of having gained
nothing by my motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that leave may be sooner or later forthcoming, on
conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the reader will find in the sequel, the leave has been given
and the conditions have been fulfilled, and Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s
personal narrative&mdash;partly taken down from his own dictation,
but for the most part extended from his manuscript&mdash;begins
with the following chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_VI" id="Ch_VI">Chapter VI.</a></h3>
<h2>The Tale Begins.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The morning after the battle of Salamanca (through which I
passed unscathed) the regiment of dragoons to which I belonged
(forming part of Anson&rsquo;s brigade), together with Bock&rsquo;s
Germans, was ordered to follow on the traces of the flying French,
who had retired across the River Tormes. Though we started at
daylight, we did not come up with their rear-guard until noon. It
consisted of a strong force of horse and foot, and made a stand
near La Serna; but the cavalry, who had received a severe lesson on
the previous day, bolted before we could cross swords with them.
The infantry, however, remained firm, and forming square, faced us
like men. The order was then given to charge; and when the two
brigades broke into a gallop and thundered down the slope, they
raised so thick a cloud of dust that all we could see of the enemy
was the glitter of their bayonets and the flash of their
musket-fire. Saddles were emptied both to the right and left of me,
and one of the riderless horses, maddened by a wound in the head,
dashed wildly forward, and leaping among the bayonets and lashing
out furiously with his hind-legs, opened a way into the square. I
was the first man through the gap, and engaged the French colonel
in a hand-to-hand combat. At the very moment just as I gave him the
point in his throat he cut open my shoulder, my horse, mortally
hurt by a bayonet thrust, fell, half rolling over me and crushing
my leg.</p>
<p>As I lay on the ground, faint with the loss of blood and unable
to rise, some of our fellows rode over me, and being hit on the
head by one of their horses, I lost consciousness. When I came to
myself the skirmish was over, nearly the whole of the French
rear-guard had been taken prisoners or cut to pieces, and a surgeon
was dressing my wounds. This done, I was removed in an ambulance to
Salamanca.</p>
<p>The historic old city, with its steep, narrow streets, numerous
convents, and famous university, had been well-nigh ruined by the
French, who had pulled down half the convents and nearly all the
colleges, and used the stones for the building of forts, which, a
few weeks previously, Wellington had bombarded with red-hot
shot.</p>
<p>The hospitals being crowded with sick and wounded, I was
billeted in the house of a certain Se&ntilde;or Don Alberto
Zamorra, which (probably owing to the fact of its having been the
quarters of a French colonel) had not taken much harm, either
during the French occupation of the town or the subsequent siege of
the forts.</p>
<p>Don Alberto gave me a hearty, albeit a dignified welcome, and
being a Spanish gentleman of the old school, he naturally placed
his house, and all that it contained, at my disposal. I did not, of
course, take this assurance literally, and had I not been on the
right side, I should doubtless have met with a very different
reception. All the same, he made a very agreeable host, and before
I had been his guest many days we became fast friends.</p>
<p>Don Zamorra was old, nearly as old as I am now; and as I
speedily discovered, he had passed the greater part of his life in
Spanish America, where he had held high office under the crown. He
could hardly talk about anything else, in fact, and once he began
to discourse about his former greatness and the marvels of the
Indies (as South and Central America were then sometimes called) he
never knew when to stop. He had crossed the Andes and seen the
Amazon, sailed down the Orinoco and visited the mines of Potosi and
Guanajuata, beheld the fiery summit of Cotopaxi, and peeped down
the smoky crater of Acatenango. He told of fights with Indians and
wild animals, of being lost in the forest, and of perilous
expeditions in search of gold and precious stones. When Zamorra
spoke of gold his whole attitude changed, the fires of his youth
blazed up afresh, his face glowed with excitement, and his eyes
sparkled with greed. At these times I saw in him a true type of the
old Spanish Conquestadores, who would baptize a cacique to save him
from hell one day, and kill him and loot his treasure the next.</p>
<p>Don Alberto had, moreover, a firm belief in the existence of the
fabled El Dorado, and of the city of Manoa, with its resplendent
house of the sun, its hoards of silver and gold, and its gilded
king. Thousands of adventurers had gone forth in search of these
wonders, and thousands had perished in the attempt to find them.
Se&ntilde;or Zamorra had sought El Dorado on the banks of the
Orinoco and the Rio Negro; others, near the source of the Rio
Grande and the Mara&ntilde;on; others, again, among the volcanoes
of Salvador and the canons of the Cordilleras. Zamorra believed
that it lay either in the wilds of Guiana, or the unexplored
confines of Peru and the Brazils.</p>
<p>He had heard of and believed even greater wonders&mdash;of a
stream on the Pacific coast of Mexico, whose pebbles were silver,
and whose sand was gold; of a volcano in the Peruvian Cordillera,
whose crater was lined with the noblest of metals, and which once
in every hundred years ejected, for days together, diamonds, and
rubies, and dust of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that volcano could only be found,&rdquo; said the don,
with a convulsive clutching of his bony fingers, and a greedy glare
in his aged eyes. &ldquo;If that volcano could only be found! Why,
it must be made of gold, and covered with precious stones! The man
who found it would be the richest in all the world&mdash;richer
than all the people in the world put together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see it, Don Alberto?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I ever see it?&rdquo; he cried, uplifting his
withered hands. &ldquo;If I had seen that volcano you would never
have seen me, but you would have heard of me. I had it from an
Indio whose father once saw it with his own eyes; but I was too
old, too old&rdquo;&mdash;sighing&mdash;&ldquo;to go on the quest.
To undertake such an enterprise a man should be in the prime of
life and go alone. A single companion, even though he were your own
brother, might be fatal; for what virtue could be proof against so
great a temptation&mdash;millions of diamonds and a mountain of
gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this roused my curiosity and fired my imagination&mdash;not
that I believed it all, for Zamorra was evidently a visionary with
a fixed idea, and as touching his craze, credulous as a child; but
in those days South America had been very little written about and
not half explored; for me it had all the charm and fascination of
the unknown&mdash;a land of romance and adventure, abounding in
grand scenery, peopled by strange races, and containing the
mightiest rivers, the greatest forests, and highest mountains in
the world.</p>
<p>When my host dismounted from his hobby he was an intelligent
talker, and told me much that was interesting about Mexico, Peru,
Guatemala, and the Spanish Main. He had several books on the
subject which I greedily devoured. The expedition of Piedro de
Ursua and Lope de Aguirre in search of El Dorado and Omagua;
&ldquo;History of the Conquest of Mexico,&rdquo; by Don Antonio de
Solis; Piedrolieta&rsquo;s &ldquo;General History of the Conquest
of the New Kingdom of Grenada,&rdquo; and others; and before we
parted I had resolved that, so soon as the war was over, I would
make a voyage to the land of the setting sun, and see for myself
the wonders of which I had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Se&ntilde;or Zamorra, when I
told him of my intention. &ldquo;America is the country of the
future. Ah, if I were only fifty years younger! You will, of
course, visit Venezuela; and if you visit Venezuela you are sure to
go to Caracas. I will give you a letter of introduction to a friend
of mine there. He is a man in authority, and may be of use to you.
I should much like you to see him and greet him on my
behalf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked my host, and promised to see his friend and present
the letter. It was addressed to Don Simon de Ulloa. Little did I
think how much trouble that letter would give me, and how near it
would come to being my death-warrant.</p>
<p>Zamorra then besought me, with tears in his eyes, to go in
search of the Golden Volcano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could give me a more definite idea of its
whereabouts I might possibly make the attempt,&rdquo; I answered,
with intentional vagueness; for though I no more believed in the
objective existence of the Golden Volcano than in Aladdin&rsquo;s
lamp, I did not wish to hurt the old man&rsquo;s feelings by an
avowal of my skepticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear sir,&rdquo; he said, with a gesture of
despair, &ldquo;if I knew the whereabouts of the Golden Volcano, I
should go thither myself, old as I am. I should have gone long ago,
and returned with a hoard of wealth that would make me the master
of Europe&mdash;wealth that would buy kingdoms. I can tell you no
more than that it is somewhere in the region of the Peruvian Andes.
It may be that by cautious inquiry you may light on an Indio who
will lead you to the very spot. It is worth the attempt, and if by
the help of St. Peter and the Holy Virgin you succeed, and I am
still alive, send me out of your abundance a few arrobas
(twenty-five pounds) of gold and a handful of diamonds. It is all I
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I find that volcano, Don Alberto,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;not a mere handful of diamonds, but a bucketful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was almost our last talk, for the very same day news was
brought that Lord Wellington, having been forced to raise the siege
of Burgos, was retreating toward the Portuguese frontier, and that
Salamanca would almost inevitably be recaptured by the French.
Orders were given for the removal of the wounded to the Coa, where
the army was to take up its winter quarters, and Zamorra and I had
to part. We parted with mutual expressions of good-will, and in the
hope, destined never to be realized, that we might soon meet again.
I had seen Don Alberto for the last time.</p>
<p>A few weeks later I was sufficiently recovered from my hurts to
use my bridle-arm, and before the opening of the next campaign I
was fit for the field and eager for the fray. It was the campaign
of Vittoria, one of the most brilliant episodes in the military
history of England. Even now my heart beats faster and the blood
tingles in my veins when I think of that time, so full of
excitement, adventure, and glory&mdash;the forcing of the Pyrenees,
the invasion of France, the battles of Bayonne, Orthes, and
Toulouse, and the march to Paris.</p>
<p>But as I am not relating a history of the war, I shall mention
only one incident in which I was concerned at this period&mdash;an
incident that brought me in contact with a man who was destined to
exercise a fateful influence on my career.</p>
<p>It occurred after the battle of Vittoria. The French were making
for the Pyrenees, laden with the loot of a kingdom and encumbered
with a motley crowd of non-combatants&mdash;the wives and families
of French officers, fair se&ntilde;oritas flying with their lovers,
and traitorous Spaniards, who, by taking sides with the invaders,
had exposed themselves to the vengeance of the patriots. So
overwhelming was the defeat of the French, that they were forced to
abandon nearly the whole of their plunder and the greater part of
their baggage, and leave the fugitives and camp-followers to their
fate.</p>
<p>Never was witnessed so strange a sight as the valley of Vittoria
presented at the close of that eventful day. The broken remains of
the French army hurrying toward the Pamplona road, eighty pieces of
artillery, served with frantic haste, covering their retreat;
thousands of wagons and carriages jammed together and unable to
move; the red-coated infantry of England, marching steadily across
the plain; the boom of the cannon, the rattle of musketry, the
scream of women as the bullets whistled through the air and shells
burst over their heads&mdash;all this made up a scene, dramatic and
picturesque, it is true, yet full of dire confusion and Dantesque
horror; for death had reaped a rich harvest, and thousands of
wounded lay writhing on the blood-stained field.</p>
<p>Owing to the bursting of packages, the overturning of wagons,
and the havoc wrought by shot and shell, valuable effects, coin,
gems, gold and silver candlesticks and vessels, priceless
paintings, the spoil of Spanish churches and convents, were strewed
over the ground. There was no need to plunder; our men picked up
money as they matched, and it was computed that a sum equal to a
million sterling found its way into their knapsacks and
pockets.</p>
<p>Our Spanish allies, officers as well as privates, were less
scrupulous. They robbed like highwaymen, and protested that they
were only taking their own.</p>
<p>While riding toward Vittoria to execute an order of the
colonel&rsquo;s, I passed a carriage which a moment or two
previously had been overtaken by several of Longa&rsquo;s dragoons,
with the evident intention of overhauling it. In the carriage were
two ladies, one young and pretty the other good-looking and mature;
and, as I judged from their appearance, both being well dressed,
the daughter and wife of a French officer of rank. They appealed to
me for help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an English officer,&rdquo; said the elder in
French; &ldquo;all the world knows that your nation is as
chivalrous as it is brave. Protect us, I pray you, from these
ruffians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed, and turning to the Spaniards, one of whom was an
officer, spoke them fair; for my business was pressing, and I had
no wish to be mixed up in a quarrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caballeros,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we do not make war on
women. You will let these ladies go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Carambo!</em> We shall do nothing of the sort,&rdquo;
returned the officer, insolently. &ldquo;These ladies are our
prisoners, and their carriage and all it contains our
prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Se&ntilde;or Capitan, but you are,
perhaps not aware that Lord Wellington has given strict orders that
private property is to be respected; and no true caballero molests
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Hijo de Dios!</em> Dare you say that I am no true
caballero? Begone this instant, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spaniard drew his sword; I drew mine; his men began to look
to the priming of their pistols, and had General Anson not chanced
to come by just in the nick of time, it might have gone ill with
me. On learning what had happened, he said I had acted very
properly and told the Spaniards that if they did not promptly
depart he would hand them over to the provost-marshal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall meet again, I hope, you and I,&rdquo; said the
officer, defiantly, as he gathered up his reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, if only that I may have an opportunity of
chastising you for your insolence,&rdquo; was my equally defiant
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks, monsieur! You have done me and my
daughter a great service,&rdquo; said the elder of the ladies.
&ldquo;Do me the pleasure to accept this ring as a slight souvenir
of our gratitude, and I trust that in happier times we may meet
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I accepted the souvenir without looking at it; reciprocated the
wish in my best French, made my best bow, and rode off on my
errand. By the same act I had made one enemy and two friends;
therefore, as I thought, the balance was in my favor. But I was
wrong, for a wider experience of the world than I then possessed
has taught me that it is better to miss making a hundred ordinary
friends than to make one inveterate enemy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_VII" id="Ch_VII">Chapter VII.</a></h3>
<h2>In Quest of Fortune.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>When the war came to an end my occupation was gone, for both
circumstances and my own will compelled me to leave the army. My
allowance could no longer be continued. At the best, the life of a
lieutenant of dragoons in peace time would have been little to my
liking; with no other resource than my pay, it would have been
intolerable. So I sent in my papers, and resolved to seek my
fortune in South America. After the payment of my debts (incurred
partly in the purchase of my first commission) and the provision of
my outfit, the sum left at my disposal was comparatively trifling.
But I possessed a valuable asset in the ring given me by the French
lady on the field of Vittoria. It was heavy, of antique make,
curiously wrought, and set with a large sapphire of incomparable
beauty. A jeweler, to whom I showed it, said he had never seen a
finer. I could have sold it for a hundred guineas. But as the gem
was property in a portable shape and more convertible than a bill
of exchange, I preferred to keep it, taking, however, the
precaution to have the sapphire covered with a composition, in
order that its value might not be too readily apparent to covetous
eyes.</p>
<p>At this time the Spanish colonies of Colombia (including the
countries now known as Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador, as also
the present republic of southern Central America) were in full
revolt against the mother country. The war had been going on for
several years with varying fortunes; but latterly the Spaniards had
been getting decidedly the best of it. Caracas and all the seaport
towns were in their possession, and the patriot cause was only
maintained by a few bands of irregulars, who were waging a
desperate and almost hopeless contest in the forests and on the
llanos of the interior.</p>
<p>My sympathies were on the popular side, and I might have joined
the volunteer force which was being raised in England for service
with the insurgents. But this did not suit my purpose. If I
accepted a commission in the Legion I should have to go where I was
ordered. I preferred to go where I listed. I had no objection to
fighting, but I wanted to do it in my own way and at my own time,
and rather in the ranks of the rebels themselves than as officer in
a foreign force.</p>
<p>This view of the case I represented to Se&ntilde;or
More&ntilde;a, one of the &ldquo;patriot&rdquo; agents in London,
and asked his advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not go to Caracas?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be the use of that? Caracas is in the hands of
the Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could get from Caracas into the interior, and do the
cause an important service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or More&ntilde;a explained that the patriots of the
capital, being sorely oppressed by the Spaniards, were losing
courage, and he wished greatly to send them a message of hope and
the assurance that help was at hand. It was also most desirable
that the insurgent leaders on the field should be informed of the
organization of a British liberating Legion, and of other measures
which were being taken to afford them relief and turn the tide of
victory in their favor.</p>
<p>But to communicate these tidings to the parties concerned was by
no means easy. The post was obviously quite out of the question,
and no Spanish creole could land at any port held by the Royalists
without the almost certainty of being promptly strangled or shot.
&ldquo;An Englishman, however&mdash;especially an Englishman who
had fought under Wellington in Spain&mdash;might undertake the
mission with comparative impunity,&rdquo; said Se&ntilde;or
More&ntilde;a.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I have
to go in the character of an ordinary travelling Englishman, and
act as an emissary of the insurgent junta. But if my true character
is detected, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not at all likely, Mr. Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet the unlikely happens sometimes&mdash;happens
generally, in fact. Suppose it does in the present
instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I am very much afraid that you would be
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not a doubt of it. Nevertheless, your proposal
pleases me, and I shall do my best to carry out your
wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Se&ntilde;or More&ntilde;a expressed his thanks in
sonorous Castilian, protested that my courage and devotion would
earn me the eternal gratitude of every patriot, and promised to
have everything ready for me in the course of the week, a promise
which he faithfully kept.</p>
<p>Three days later More&ntilde;a brought me a packet of letters
and a memorandum containing minute instructions for my guidance.
Nothing could be more harmless looking than the letters. They
contained merely a few items of general news and the recommendation
of the bearer to the good offices of the recipient. But this was
only a blind; the real letters were written in cipher, with
sympathetic ink. They were, moreover, addressed to secret friends
of the revolutionary cause, who, as Se&ntilde;or More&ntilde;a
believed and hoped, were, as yet, unsuspected by the Spanish
authorities, and at large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To give you letters to known patriots would be simply to
insure your destruction,&rdquo; said the se&ntilde;or, &ldquo;even
if you were to find them alive and at liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had also Don Alberto&rsquo;s letter, and as the old gentleman
had once been president of the <em>Audiencia Real</em> (Royal
Council), More&ntilde;a thought it would be of great use to me, and
serve to ward off suspicion, even though some of the friends to
whom he had himself written should have meanwhile got into
trouble.</p>
<p>But as if he had not complete confidence in the efficacy of
these elaborate precautions, Se&ntilde;or More&ntilde;a strongly
advised me to stay no longer in Caracas than I could possibly
help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spies more vigilant than those of the Inquisition are
continually on the lookout for victims,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;An
inadvertent word, a look even, might betray you; the only law is
the will of the military and police, and they make very short work
of those whom they suspect. Yes, leave Caracas the moment you have
delivered your letters; our friends will smuggle you through the
Spanish line and lead you to one of the patriot camps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not very encouraging; but I was at an adventurous age
and in an enterprising mood, and the creole&rsquo;s warnings had
rather the effect of increasing my desire to go forward with the
undertaking in which I had engaged than causing me to falter in my
resolve. Like Napoleon, I believed in my star, and I had faced
death too often on the field of battle to fear the rather remote
dangers More&ntilde;a had foreshadowed, and in whose existence I
only half believed.</p>
<p>The die being cast, the next question was how I should reach my
destination. The Spaniards of that age kept the trade with their
colonies in their own hands, and it was seldom, indeed, that a ship
sailed from the Thames for La Guayra or any other port on the Main.
I was, however, lucky enough to find a vessel in the river taking
in cargo for the island of Cura&ccedil;oa, which had just been
ceded by England to the Dutch, from whom it was captured in 1807,
and for a reasonable consideration the master agreed to fit me up a
cabin and give me a passage.</p>
<p>The voyage was rather long&mdash;something like fifty
days&mdash;yet not altogether uneventful; for in the course of it
we were chased by an American privateer, overhauled by a Spanish
cruiser, nearly caught by a pirate, and almost swamped in a
hurricane; but we fortunately escaped these and all other dangers,
and eventually reached our haven in safety.</p>
<p>I had brought with me letters of credit on a Dutch merchant at
Cura&ccedil;oa, of the name of Van Voorst, from whom I obtained as
much coin as I thought would cover my expenses for a few months,
and left the balance in his hands on deposit. With the help of this
gentleman, moreover, I chartered a <em>falucha</em> for the voyage
to La Guayra. Also at his suggestion, moreover, I stitched several
gold pieces in the lining of my vest and the waistband of my
trousers, as a reserve in case of accident.</p>
<p>We made the run in twenty-four hours, and as the
<em>falucha</em> let go in the roadstead I tore up my memorandum of
instructions (which I had carefully committed to memory) and threw
the fragments into the sea.</p>
<p>A little later we were boarded by two revenue officers, who
seemed more surprised than pleased to see me; as, however, my
papers were in perfect order, and nothing either compromising or
contraband was found in my possession, they allowed me to land, and
I thought that my troubles (for the present) were over. But I had
not been ashore many minutes when I was met by a sergeant and a
file of soldiers, who asked me politely, yet firmly, to accompany
them to the commandant of the garrison.</p>
<p>I complied, of course, and was conducted to the barracks, where
I found the gentleman in question lolling in a <em>chinchura</em>
(hammock) and smoking a cigar. He eyed me with great suspicion, and
after examining my passport, demanded my business, and wanted to
know why I had taken it into my head to visit Colombia at a time
when the country was being convulsed with civil war.</p>
<p>Thinking it best to answer frankly (with one or two
reservations), I said that, having heard much of South America
while campaigning in Spain, I had made up my mind to voyage thither
on the first opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you have served in Spain, in the army of Lord
Wellington!&rdquo; interposed the commandant with great
vivacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I joined shortly before the battle of Salamanca,
where I was wounded. I was also at Vittoria, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I. I commanded a regiment in Murillo&rsquo;s
<em>corps d&rsquo;arm&eacute;e</em>, and have come out with him to
Colombia. We are brothers in arms. We have both bled in the sacred
cause of Spanish independence. Let me embrace you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the commandant, springing from his hammock, put his
arms round my neck and his head on my shoulders, patted me on the
back, and kissed me on both cheeks, a salute which I thought it
expedient to return, though his face was not overclean and he
smelled abominably of garlic and stale tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have come to see South America&mdash;only to see
it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But perhaps you are scientific; you have
the intention to explore the country and write a book, like the
illustrious Humboldt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea was useful. I modestly admitted that I did cultivate a
little science, and allowed my &ldquo;brother-in-arms&rdquo; to
remain in the belief that I proposed to follow in the footsteps of
the author of &ldquo;Cosmos&rdquo;&mdash;at a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an immense respect for science,&rdquo; continued
the commandant, &ldquo;and I doubt not that you will write a book
which will make you famous. My only regret is, that in the present
state of the country you may find going about rather difficult. But
it won&rsquo;t be for long. We have well-nigh got this accursed
rebellion under. A few weeks more, and there will not be a rebel
left alive between the Andes and the Atlantic. The Captain-General
of New Granada reports that he has either shot or hanged every
known patriot in the province. We are doing the same here in
Venezuela. We give no quarter; it is the only way with rebels.
<em>Guerra a la muerte!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this the commandant asked me to dinner, and insisted on my
becoming his guest until the morrow, when he would provide me with
mules for myself and my baggage, and give me an escort to Caracas,
and letter of introduction to one of his friends there. So great
was his kindness, indeed, that only the ferocious sentiments which
he had avowed in respect of the rebels reconciled me to the
deception which I was compelled to practise. I accepted his
hospitality and his offer of mules and an escort, and the next
morning I set out on the first stage of my inland journey. Before
parting he expressed a hope&mdash;which I deemed it prudent to
reciprocate&mdash;that we should meet again.</p>
<p>Nothing can be finer than the ride to Caracas by the old Spanish
road, or more superb than its position in a magnificent valley,
watered by four rivers, surrounded by a rampart of lofty mountains,
and enjoying, by reason of its altitude, a climate of perpetual
spring. But the city itself wore an aspect of gloom and desolation.
Four years previously the ground on which it stood had been torn
and rent by a succession of terrible earthquakes in which hundreds
of houses were levelled with the earth, and thousands of its people
bereft of their lives. Since that time two sieges, and wholesale
proscription and executions, first by one side and then by the
other, had well-nigh completed its destruction. Its principal
buildings were still in ruins, and half its population had either
perished or fled. Nearly every civilian whom I met in the streets
was in mourning. Even the Royalists (who were more numerous than I
expected) looked unhappy, for all had suffered either in person or
in property, and none knew what further woes the future might bring
them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_VIII" id="Ch_VIII">Chapter VIII.</a></h3>
<h2>In the King&rsquo;s Name.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I put up at the Posado de los Generales (recommended by the
commandant), and the day after my arrival I delivered the letters
confided to me by Se&ntilde;or More&ntilde;o. This done, I felt
safe; for (as I thought) there was nothing else in my possession by
which I could possibly be compromised. I did not deliver the
letters separately. I gave the packet, just as I had received it,
to a certain Se&ntilde;or Carera, the secret chief of the patriot
party in Caracas. I also gave him a long verbal message from
More&ntilde;o, and we discussed at length the condition of the
country and the prospects of the insurrection. In the interior, he
said, there raged a frightful guerilla warfare, and Caracas was
under a veritable reign of terror. Of the half-dozen friends for
whom I had brought letters, one had been garroted; another was in
prison, and would almost certainly meet the same fate. It was only
by posing as a loyalist and exercising the utmost circumspection
that he had so far succeeded in keeping a whole skin; and if he
were not convinced that he could do more for the cause where he was
than elsewhere, he would not remain in the city another hour. As
for myself, he was quite of More&ntilde;o&rsquo;s opinion, that the
sooner I got away the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider it my duty to watch over your safety,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I should be sorry indeed were any harm to befall an
English caballero who has risked his life to serve us and brought
us such good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What harm can befall me, now that I have got rid of that
packet?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a city under martial law and full of spies, there is
no telling what may happen. Being, moreover, a stranger, you are a
marked man. It is not everybody who, like the commandant of La
Guayra, will believe that you are travelling for your own pleasure.
What man in his senses would choose a time like this for a
scientific ramble in Venezuela?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Se&ntilde;or Carera explained that he could arrange for
me to leave Caracas almost immediately, under excellent guidance.
The <em>teniente</em> of Colonel Mejia, one of the guerilla
leaders, was in the town on a secret errand, and would set out on
his return journey in three days. If I liked I might go with him,
and I could not have a better guide or a more trustworthy
companion.</p>
<p>It was a chance not to be lost. I told Se&ntilde;or Carera that
I should only be too glad to profit by the opportunity, and that on
any day and at any hour which he might name I would be ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see the <em>teniente</em>, and let you know
further in the course of to-morrow,&rdquo; said Carera, after a
moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;The affair will require nice
management. There are patrols on every road. You must be well
mounted, and I suppose you will want a mule for your
baggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I shall take no more than I can carry in my
saddle-bags. We must not be incumbered with pack-mules on an
expedition of this sort. We may have to ride for our
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right, Se&ntilde;or Fortescue; so you may.
I will see that you are well mounted, and I shall be delighted to
take charge of your belongings until the patriots again, and for
the last time, capture Caracas and drive those thrice-accursed
Spaniards into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before we separated I invited Se&ntilde;or Carera to
<em>almuerzo</em> (the equivalent to the Continental second
breakfast) on the following day.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s reflection he accepted the invitation.
&ldquo;But we shall have to be very cautious,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;The <em>posada</em> is a Royalist house, and the
<em>posadero</em> (innkeeper) is hand and glove with the police. If
we speak of the patriots at all, it must be only to abuse
them&hellip;. But our turn will come, and&mdash;<em>por
Dios!</em>&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierce light in Carera&rsquo;s eyes, the gesture by which
his words were emphasized, boded no good for the Royalists if the
patriots should get the upper hand. No wonder that a war in which
men like him were engaged on the one side, and men like el
Commandant Castro on the other, should be savage, merciless, and
&ldquo;to the death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I had decided to quit Caracas so soon, it did not seem worth
while presenting the letter to one of his brother officers which I
had received from Commandant Castro. I thought, too, that in
existing circumstances the less I had to do with officers the
better. But I did not like the idea of going away without
fulfilling my promise to call on Zamorra&rsquo;s old friend, Don
Se&ntilde;or Ulloa.</p>
<p>So when I returned to the <em>posada</em> I asked the
<em>posadero</em> (innkeeper), a tall Biscayan, with an immensely
long nose, a cringing manner, and an insincere smile, if he would
kindly direct me to Se&ntilde;or Ulloa&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Si, se&ntilde;or</em>,&rdquo; said the
<em>posadero</em>, giving me a queer look, and exchanging
significant glances with two or three of his guests who were within
earshot. &ldquo;<em>Si, se&ntilde;or</em>, I can direct you to the
house of Se&ntilde;or Ulloa. You mean Don Simon, of
course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have a letter of introduction to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have a letter of introduction to Don Simon! if
you will come into the street I will show you the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon we went outside, and the <em>posadero</em>, pointing
out the church of San Ildefonso, told me that the large house over
against the eastern door was the house I sought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gracias, se&ntilde;or</em>,&rdquo; I said, as I
started on my errand, taking the shady side of the street and
walking slowly, for the day was warm.</p>
<p>I walked slowly and thought deeply, trying to make out what
could be the meaning of the glances which the mention of
Se&ntilde;or Ulloa&rsquo;s name had evoked, and there was a
nameless something in the <em>posadero&rsquo;s</em> manner I did
not like. Besides being cringing, as usual, it was half mocking,
half menacing, as if I had said, or he had heard, something that
placed me in his power.</p>
<p>Yet what could he have heard? What could there be in the name of
Ulloa to either excite his enmity or rouse his suspicion? As a man
in authority, and the particular friend of an ex-president of the
<em>Audiencia Real</em>, Don Simon must needs be above
reproach.</p>
<p>Should I turn back and ask the <em>posadero</em> what he meant?
No, that were both weak and impolitic. He would either answer me
with a lie, or refuse to answer at all, <em>qui s&rsquo;excuse
s&rsquo;accuse</em>. I resolved to go on, and see what came of it.
Don Simon would no doubt be able to enlighten me.</p>
<p>I found the place without difficulty. There could be no
mistaking it&mdash;a large house over against the eastern door of
the church of San Ildefonso, built round a <em>patio</em>, or
courtyard, after the fashion of Spanish and South American
mansions. Like the church, it seemed to have been much damaged by
the earthquake; the outer walls were cracked, and the gateway was
encumbered with fallen stones.</p>
<p>This surprised me less than may be supposed. Creoles are not
remarkable for energy, and it was quite possible that Se&ntilde;or
Ulloa&rsquo;s fortunes might have suffered as severely from the war
as his house had suffered from the earthquake. But when I entered
the <em>patio</em> I was more than surprised. The only visible
signs of life were lizards, darting in and out of their holes, and
a huge rattlesnake sunning himself on the ledge of a broken
fountain. Grass was growing between the stones; rotten doors hung
on rusty hinges; there were great gaps in the roof and huge
fissures in the walls, and when I called no one answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;I have made some
mistake. This house is both deserted and ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned to the street and accosted a passer-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the house of Don Simon Ulloa?&rdquo; I asked
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Si, Se&ntilde;or</em>,&rdquo; he said; and then
hurried on as if my question had half-frightened him out of his
wits.</p>
<p>I could not tell what to make of this; but my first idea was
that Se&ntilde;or Ulloa was dead, and the house had the reputation
of being haunted. In any case, the innkeeper had evidently played
me a scurvy trick, and I went back to the <em>posada</em> with the
full intention of having it out with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find the house of Don Simon, Se&ntilde;or
Fortescue?&rdquo; he asked when he saw me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I did not find him. The house is empty and
deserted. What do you mean by sending me on such a fool&rsquo;s
errand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, se&ntilde;or. You asked me to direct
you to Se&ntilde;or Ulloa&rsquo;s house, and I did so. What could I
do more?&rdquo; And the fellow cringed and smirked, as if it were
all a capital joke, till I could hardly refrain from pulling his
long nose first and kicking him afterwards, but I listened to the
voice of prudence and resisted the impulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know quite well that I sought Se&ntilde;or Ulloa. Did
I not tell you that I had a letter for him? If you were a caballero
instead of a wretched <em>posadero</em>, I would chastise your
trickery as it deserves. What has become of Se&ntilde;or Ulloa, and
how comes it that his house is deserted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ulloa is dead. He was garroted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garroted! What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treason. There was discovered a compromising
correspondence between him and Bolivar. But why ask me? As a friend
of Se&ntilde;or Ulloa, you surely know all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was a friend of his&mdash;never even saw him! I
had merely a letter to him from a common friend. But how happened
it that Se&ntilde;or Ulloa, who, I believe, was a
<em>correjidor</em>, entered into a correspondence with the
arch-traitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That made it all the worse. He richly deserved his fate.
His eldest son, who was privy to the affair, was strangled at the
same time as his father; his other children fled, and Se&ntilde;ora
Ulloa died of grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor woman! No wonder the house is deserted. What a
frightful state of things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, feeling that I had said enough, and fearing that I
might say more, I turned on my heel, lighted a cigar, and, while I
paced to and fro in the <em>patio</em>, seriously considered my
position, which, as I clearly perceived, was beginning to be rather
precarious.</p>
<p>As likely as not the innkeeper would denounce me, and then it
would, of course, be very absurd, for I was utterly ignorant, and
Zamorra, a Royalist to the bone, must have been equally ignorant
that his friend Ulloa had any hand in the rebellion. The mere fact
of carrying a harmless letter of introduction from a well-known
loyalist to a friend whom he believed to be still a loyalist, could
surely not be construed as an offense. At any rate it ought not to
be. But when I recalled all I had heard from More&ntilde;a, and the
stories told me but an hour before by Carera, I thought it
extremely probable that it would be, and bitterly regretted that I
had not mentioned to the latter Ulloa&rsquo;s name. He would have
put me on my guard, and I should not have so fatally committed
myself with the <em>posadero</em>.</p>
<p>But regrets are useless and worse. They waste time and weaken
resolve. The question of the moment was, What should I do? How
avoid the danger which I felt sure was impending? There seemed only
one way&mdash;immediate flight. I would go to Carera, tell him all
that had happened, and ask him to arrange for my departure from
Caracas that very night. I could steal away unseen when all was
quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once,&rdquo; I said to myself&mdash;&ldquo;at once. If
I exaggerate, if the danger be not so pressing as I fear, he is
just the man to tell me; but, first of all, I will go into my room
and destroy this confounded letter. The <em>posadero</em> did not
see it. All that he can say is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the king&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; exclaimed a rough voice
behind me; and a heavy hand was laid on my arm.</p>
<p>Turning sharply round, I found myself confronted by an officer
of police and four alguazils, all armed to the teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrest you in the king&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; repeated
the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what charge?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treason. Giving aid and comfort to the king&rsquo;s
enemies, and acting as a medium of communication between rebels
against his authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; I am ready to accompany you,&rdquo; I said,
seeing that, for the moment at least, resistance and escape were
equally out of the question; &ldquo;but the charge is
false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I have nothing to do with. The case is one for the
military tribunal. Before we go I must search your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so, and, except my passport, found nothing whatever of a
documentary, much less of a compromising character. He then
searched me, and took possession of Zamorra&rsquo;s unlucky letter
to Ulloa and my memorandum-book, in which, however, there were
merely a few commonplace notes and scientific jottings.</p>
<p>This done he placed two of his alguazils on either side of me,
telling them to run me through with their bayonets if I attempted
to escape, and then, drawing his sword and bringing up the rear,
gave the order to march.</p>
<p>As we passed through the gateway I caught sight of the
<em>posadero</em>, laughing consumedly, and pointing at me the
finger of scorn and triumph. How sorry I felt that I had not kicked
him when I was in the humor and had the opportunity!</p>

<h2>Doomed to Die.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>My captors conducted me to a dilapidated building near the Plaza
Major, which did duty as a temporary jail, the principal prison of
Caracas having been destroyed by the earthquake and left as it
fell. Nevertheless, the room to which I was taken seemed quite
strong enough to hold anybody unsupplied with housebreaking
implements or less ingenious than Jack Sheppard. The door was thick
and well bolted, the window or grating (for it was, of course,
destitute of glass) high and heavily barred, yet not too high to be
reached with a little contrivance. Mounting the single chair
(beside a hammock the only furniture the room contained), I gripped
the bars with my hands, raised myself up, and looked out. Below me
was a narrow, and, as it might appear, a little-frequented street,
at the end of which a sentry was doing his monotonous spell of
duty.</p>
<p>The place was evidently well guarded, and from the number of
soldiers whom I had seen about the gateway and in the
<em>patio</em>, I concluded that, besides serving as a jail, it was
used also as a military post. Even though I might get out, I should
not find it very easy to get away. And what were my chances of
getting out? As yet they seemed exceedingly remote. The only
possible exits were the door and the window. The door was both
locked and bolted, and either to open or make an opening in it I
should want a brace and bit and a saw, and several hours freedom
from intrusion. It would be easier to cut the bars&mdash;if I
possessed a file or a suitable saw. I had my knife, and with time
and patience I might possibly fashion a tool that would answer the
purpose.</p>
<p>But time was just what I might not be able to command. I had
heard that the sole merit of the military tribunal was its
promptitude; it never kept its victims long in suspense; they were
either quickly released or as quickly despatched&mdash;the latter
being the alternative most generally adopted. It was for this
reason that, the moment I was arrested, I began to think how I
could escape. As neither opening the door nor breaking the bars
seemed immediately feasible, the idea of bribing the turnkey
naturally occurred to me. Thanks to the precaution suggested by Mr.
Van Voorst, I had several gold pieces in my belt. But though the
fellow would no doubt accept my money, what security had I that he
would keep his word? And how, even if he were to leave the door
open, should I evade the vigilance of the sentries and the soldiers
who were always loitering in the <em>patio</em>?</p>
<p>On the whole, I thought the best thing I could do was to wait
quietly until the morrow. The night is often fruitful in ideas. I
might be acquitted, after all, and if I attempted to bribe the
turnkey before my examination, and he should betray me to his
superiors, my condemnation would be a foregone conclusion. The mere
attempt would be regarded as an admission of guilt.</p>
<p>A while later, the zambo turnkey (half Indian, half negro)
brought me my evening meal&mdash;a loaf of bread and a small bottle
of wine&mdash;and I studied his countenance closely. It was both
treacherous and truculent, and I felt that if I trusted him he
would be sure to play me false.</p>
<p>As it was near sunset I asked for a light, and tried to engage
him in conversation. But the attempt failed. He answered surlily,
that a dark room was quite good enough for a damned rebel, and left
me to myself.</p>
<p>When it became too dark to walk about, I lay down in the hammock
and was soon in the land of dreams; for I was young and sanguine,
and though I could not help feeling somewhat anxious, it was not
the sort of anxiety which kills sleep. Only once in my life have I
tasted the agony of despair. That time was not yet.</p>
<p>When I awoke the clock of a neighboring church was striking
three, and the rays of a brilliant tropical moon were streaming
through the barred window of my room, making it hardly less light
than day.</p>
<p>As the echo of the last stroke dies away, I fancy that I hear
something strike against the grating.</p>
<p>I rise up in my hammock, listening intently, and at the same
instant a small shower of pebbles, flung by an unseen hand, falls
into the room.</p>
<p>A signal!</p>
<p>Yes, and a signal that demands an answer. In less time than it
takes to tell I slip from my hammock, gather up the pebbles, climb
up to the window, and drop them into the street. Then, looking out,
I can just discern, deep in the shadow of the building opposite,
the figure of a man. He raises his arm; something white flies over
my head and falls on the floor. Dropping hurriedly from the
grating, I pick up the message-bearing missile&mdash;a pebble to
which is tied a piece of paper. I can see that the paper contains
writing, and climbing a second time up to the grating, I make out
by the light of the moonbeams the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>If you are condemned, ask for a
priest.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>My first feeling was one of bitter disappointment. Why should I
ask for a priest? I was not a Roman Catholic; I did not want to
confess. If the author of the missive was Carera&mdash;and who else
could it be?&mdash;why had he given himself so much trouble to make
so unpleasantly suggestive a recommendation? A priest, forsooth! A
file and a cord would be much more to the purpose&hellip;. But
might not the words mean more than appeared? Could it be that
Carera desired to give me a friendly hint to prepare for the
worst?&hellip; Or was it possible that the ghostly man would bring
me a further message and help me in some way to escape? At any
rate, it was a more encouraging theory than the other, and I
resolved to act on it. If the priest did me no good, he could, at
least, do me no harm.</p>
<p>After tearing up the bit of paper and chewing the fragments, I
returned to my hammock and lay awake&mdash;sleep being now out of
the question&mdash;until the turnkey brought me a cup of chocolate,
of which, with the remains of the loaf, I made my first breakfast.
About the middle of the day he brought me something more
substantial. On both occasions I pressed him with questions as to
when I was to be examined, and what they were going to do with me,
to all of which he answered &ldquo;<em>No se</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;), and, probably enough, he told the truth.
However, I was not kept long in suspense. Later on in the afternoon
the door opened for the third time, and the officer who had
arrested me, followed by his alguazils, appeared at the threshold
and announced that he had been ordered to escort me to the
tribunal.</p>
<p>We went in the same order as before; and a walk of less than
fifteen minutes brought us to another tumble-down building, which
appeared to have been once a court-house. Only the lower rooms were
habitable, and at a door, on either side of which stood a sentry,
my conductor respectfully knocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Adelante!</em>&rdquo; said a rough voice; and we
entered accordingly.</p>
<p>Before a long table at the upper end of a large,
barely-furnished room, with rough walls and a cracked ceiling, sat
three men in uniform. The one who occupied the chief seat, and
seemed to be the president, was old and gray, with hard, suspicious
eyes, and a long, typical Spanish face, in every line of which I
read cruelty and ruthless determination. His colleagues, who called
him &ldquo;marquis,&rdquo; treated him with great deference, and
his breast was covered with orders.</p>
<p>It was evident that on this man would depend my fate. The others
were there merely to register his decrees.</p>
<p>After leading me to the table and saluting the tribunal, the
officer of police, whose sword was still drawn, placed himself in a
convenient position for running me through, in the event of my
behaving disrespectfully to the tribunal or attempting to
escape.</p>
<p>The president, who had before him the letter to Se&ntilde;or
Ulloa, my passport, and a document that looked like a brief,
demanded my name and quality.</p>
<p>I told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was your purpose in coming to Caracas?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply to see the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see the country! What nonsense is this? How can
anybody see a country which is ravaged by brigands and convulsed
with civil war? And where is your authority?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My passport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A passport such as this is only available in a time of
peace. No stranger unprovided with a safe conduct from the
<em>capitan-general</em> is allowed to travel in the province of
Caracas. It is useless trying to deceive us, se&ntilde;or. Your
purpose is to carry information to the rebels, probably to join
them, as is proved by your possession of a letter to so base a
traitor as Se&ntilde;or Ulloa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this I explained how I had obtained the letter, and pointed
out that the very fact of my asking the <em>posadero</em> to direct
me to Ulloa&rsquo;s house, and going thither openly, was proof
positive of my innocence. Had my purpose been that which he imputed
to me, I should have shown more caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does not at all follow,&rdquo; rejoined the
president. &ldquo;You may have intended to disarm suspicion by a
pretence of ignorance. Moreover, you expressed to the
<em>se&ntilde;or posadero</em> sentiments hostile to the Government
of his Majesty the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is untrue. I did nothing of the sort,&rdquo; I
exclaimed, impetuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind what you say, prisoner. Unless you treat the
tribunal with due respect you shall be sent back to the
<em>carcel</em> and tried in your absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call this a trial?&rdquo; I exclaimed,
indignantly. &ldquo;I am a British subject. I have committed no
offence; but if I must be tried I demand the right of being tried
by a civil tribunal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;British subjects who venture into a city under martial
law must take the consequences. We can show them no more
consideration than we show Spanish subjects. They deserve much
less, indeed. At this moment a force is being organized in England,
with the sanction and encouragement of the British Government, to
serve against our troops in these colonies. This is an act of war,
and if the king, my master, were of my mind, he would declare war
against England. Better an open foe than a treacherous friend. Do
you hold a commission in the Legion, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know you anybody who does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I believe that several men with whom I served in
Spain have accepted commissions. But you will surely not hold me
responsible for the doings of others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. You have quite enough sins of your own to
answer for. You may not actually hold a commission in this force of
filibusters, but you are acquainted with people who do; and from
your own admission and facts that have come to our knowledge, we
believe that you are acting as an intermediary between the rebels
in this country and their agents in England. It is an insult to our
understanding to tell us that you have come here out of idle
curiosity. You have come to spy out the nakedness of the land, and
being a soldier you know how spies are dealt with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the president held a whispered consultation with his
colleagues. Then he turned to me, and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are of opinion that the charges against you have been
fully made out, and the sentence of the court is that you be
strangled on the Plaza Major to-morrow morning at seven by the
clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangled! Surely, se&ntilde;ores, you will not commit so
great an infamy? This is a mere mockery of a trial. I have neither
seen an indictment nor been confronted by witnesses. Call this a
sentence! I call it murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not moderate your language, prisoner, you will
be strangled to-night instead of to-morrow. Remove him,
<em>capitan</em>&ldquo;&mdash;to the officer of police. &ldquo;Let
this be your warrant&rdquo;&mdash;writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grant me at least one favor,&rdquo; I asked, smothering
my indignation, and trying to speak calmly. &ldquo;I have fought
and bled for Spain. Let me at least die a soldier&rsquo;s death,
and allow me before I die to see a priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are a Christian!&rdquo; returned the president,
almost graciously. &ldquo;I thought all Englishmen were heretics. I
think se&ntilde;ores, we may grant Se&ntilde;or Fortescue&rsquo;s
request. Instead of being strangled, you shall be shot by a firing
party of the regiment of Cordova, and you may see a priest. We
would not have you die unshriven, and I will myself see that your
body is laid in consecrated ground. When would you like the priest
to visit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This evening, se&ntilde;or president. There will not be
much time to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. See to it, <em>capitan</em>. Tell them at
the <em>carcel</em> that Se&ntilde;or Fortescue may see a priest in
his own room this evening. <em>Adios se&ntilde;or!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that my three judges rose from their seats and bowed as
politely as if they were parting with an honored guest. Though this
proceeding struck me as being both ghastly and grotesque, I
returned the greeting in due form, and made my best bow. I learned
afterward that I had really been treated with exceptional
consideration, and might esteem myself fortunate in not being
condemned without trial and strangled without notice.</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>Now that I knew beyond a doubt what would be my fate unless I
could escape before morning, I became decidedly anxious as to the
outcome of my approaching interview with the ghostly comforter for
whom I had asked. It was my last chance. If it failed me, or the
man turned out to be a priest and nothing more, my hours were
numbered. The time was too short to arrange any other plan. Would
he bring with him a file and a cord? Even if he did, we could
hardly hope to cut through the bars before daylight. And, most
important consideration of all, how would Carera contrive to send
me the right man?</p>
<p>The mystery was solved more quickly than I expected.</p>
<p>After leaving the tribunal, my escort took me back by the way we
had come, the police captain, who was showing himself much more
friendly (probably because he looked on me as a good
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; and a dying man), walking beside instead of
behind me; and when we were within a hundred yards or so of the
<em>carcel</em> I observed a Franciscan friar pacing slowly toward
us.</p>
<p>I felt intuitively that this was my man; and when he drew nearer
a slight movement of his eyebrows and a quick look of intelligence
told me that I was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no acquaintance among the clergy of
Caracas,&rdquo; I said to my conductor. &ldquo;This friar will
serve my purpose as well as a regular priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like, se&ntilde;or. Shall I ask him to see
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gracias se&ntilde;or capitan</em>, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the officer respectfully accosted the friar, and after
telling him that I had been condemned to die at sunrise on the
morrow, asked if he would receive my confession and give me such
religious consolation as my case required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Con mucho gusto, capitan</em>,&rdquo; answered the
friar. &ldquo;When would the se&ntilde;or like me to visit
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once, father. My hours are numbered, and I would fain
spend the night in meditation and prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us, father,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;The
se&ntilde;or has the permission of the tribunal to see a priest in
his own room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we entered the prison together, and the captain, having given
the necessary instructions to the turnkey, we were conducted to my
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have done,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;knock at the
door, and I will come and let you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! But you need not wait. I shall not be ready for
half an hour or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the key turned in the lock, the <em>soi-disant</em> friar
threw back his cowl. &ldquo;Now, Se&ntilde;or Fortescue,&rdquo; he
said, with a laugh, &ldquo;I am ready to hear your
confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess that I feel as if I were in purgatory already,
and I shall be uncommonly glad if you can get me out of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, purgatory is not the pleasantest of places by all
accounts, and I am quite willing to do whatever I can for you. By
way of beginning, take this ointment and smear your face and hands
therewith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make you look swart and ugly, like the
zambo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then? When the turnkey comes back we shall overpower,
bind, and gag him&mdash;if he resists, strangle him. Then you will
put on his clothes and don his sombrero, and as the moon rises
late, and the prison is badly lighted, I have no doubt we shall run
the gauntlet of the guard without difficulty&hellip;. That is a
splendid ointment. You are almost as dark as a negro. Now for your
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feet! I see! I must go out barefoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Who ever heard of a zambo turnkey wearing
shoes? I will hide yours under my habit, and you can put them on
afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a friend of Carera&rsquo;s, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I am Salvador Carmen, the <em>teniente</em> of
Colonel Mejia, at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salvador Carmen! A name of good omen. You are saving
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will either save you or perish with you. Take this
dagger. Better to die fighting than be strangled on the
plaza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your plan or Carera&rsquo;s?&rdquo; I asked, as I
put the dagger in my belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly his and partly mine, I think. When he heard of
your arrest, he said that it concerned our honor to effect your
rescue. The idea of throwing a stone through the window was
Carera&rsquo;s; that of personating a priest was mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did Carera find out where I was? and what
assurance had you that when I asked for a priest they would bring
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was easy enough. This is a small military post as
well as an occasional prison, some of the soldiers are always
drinking at the <em>pulperia</em> round the corner, and they talk
in their cups. I even know the countersign for to-night. It is
&lsquo;Baylen.&rsquo; I saw them take you to the tribunal, and as I
knew that when you asked for a priest they would call in the first
whom they saw, just to save themselves the trouble of going
farther, I took care to be hereabout in this guise as you returned.
I was fortunate enough to meet you face to face, and you were sharp
enough to detect my true character at a glance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am greatly indebted to you and Se&ntilde;or
Carera&mdash;more than I can say. You are risking your lives to
save mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nothing, my dear sir. I often risk my life twenty
times in a day. And what matters it? We are all under sentence of
death. A few years and there will be an end of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salvador Carmen may have been twenty-six or twenty-eight years
old. He was of middle height and athletic build, yet wiry withal,
in splendid condition, and as hard as nails. Though darker than the
average Spaniard, his short, wavy hair and powerful, clear-cut
features showed that his blood was free from negro or Indian taint.
His face bespoke a strange mixture of gentleness and resolution,
melancholy and ferocity, as if an originally fine nature had been
annealed by fiery trials, and perhaps perverted by some terrible
wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or, we carry our lives in our hands in
this most unhappy country,&rdquo; he continued, after a short
pause. &ldquo;Three years ago I was one of a family of eight, and
no happier family could be found in the whole
<em>capitanio-general</em> of Caracas&hellip;. Of those eight,
seven are gone; I am the only one left. Four were killed in the
great earthquake. Then my father took part in the revolutionary
movement, and to save his life had to leave his home. One night he
returned in disguise to see my mother. I happened to be away at the
time; but my brother Tomas was there, and the police getting wind
of my father&rsquo;s arrival, arrested both them and him. My father
was condemned as a rebel; my mother and brother were condemned for
harboring him, and all were strangled together on the plaza
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heaven! Can such things be?&rdquo; I said, as much
moved by his grief as by his tale of horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw them die. Oh, my God! I saw them die, and yet I
live to tell the tale!&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen, in a tone of
intense sadness. &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;fiercely&mdash;&ldquo;I
have taken a terrible revenge. With my own hand have I slain more
than a hundred European Spaniards, and I have sworn to slay as many
as there were hairs on my mother&rsquo;s head&hellip;. But enough
of this! The night is upon us. It is time to make ready. When the
zambo comes in, I shall seize him by the throat and threaten him
with my dagger. While I hold him you must stuff this cloth into his
mouth, take off his shirt and trousers&mdash;he has no other
garments&mdash;and put them on over your own. That done, we will
bind him with this cord, and lock him in with his own key. Are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen knocked loudly at the door.</p>
<p>Two minutes later the door opens, and as the zambo closes it
behind him, Carmen seizes him by the throat and pushes him against
the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word, a whisper, and you are a dead man!&rdquo; he
hisses, sternly, at the same time drawing his dagger. &ldquo;Open
your mouth, or, <em>per Dios</em>&mdash;The cloth, se&ntilde;or.
Now, off with your shirt and trousers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The turnkey obeys without the least attempt at resistance. The
shaking of his limbs as I help him to undress shows that he is half
frightened to death.</p>
<p>Then Carmen, still gripping the man&rsquo;s throat and
threatening him with his dagger, makes him lie down, and I bind his
arms with the cord.</p>
<p>That done, I slip the man&rsquo;s trousers and shirt over my
own, don his sombrero, and take his key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far, well,&rdquo; says Carmen, &ldquo;if we only get
safely through the <em>patio</em> and pass the guard! Put the
sombrero over your face, imitate the zambo&rsquo;s shuffling gait,
and walk carelessly by my side, as if you were conducting me to the
gate and a short way down the street. Have you your dagger! Good!
Open the door and let us go forth. One word more! If it comes to a
fight, back to back. Try to grasp the muskets with your left and
stab with your right&mdash;upward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XI" id="Ch_XI">Chapter XI.</a></h3>
<h2>Out of the Lion&rsquo;s Mouth.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>As the short sunset of the tropics had now merged into complete
darkness, we crossed the <em>patio</em> without being noticed; but
near the gateway several soldiers of the guard were seated round a
small table, playing at cards by the light of a flickering
lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Who goes there?&rdquo; said one of them, looking
up. &ldquo;Pablo, the turnkey, and a friar! Won&rsquo;t you take a
hand, Pablo? You won a <em>real</em> from me last night; I want my
revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going with me as far as the plaza. It is dark, and
I am very near-sighted,&rdquo; put in Carmen, with ready presence
of mind. &ldquo;He will be back in a few minutes, and then he will
give you your revenge, won&rsquo;t you, Pablo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Si, padre, con mucho gusto</em>,&rdquo; I answered,
mimicking the deep guttural of the zambo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I shall expect you in a few minutes,&rdquo; said
the soldier. &ldquo;<em>Buene noche, padre!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the sentry,&rdquo; murmured Carmen;
&ldquo;luckily we have the password, otherwise it might be
awkward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must try to slip past him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not to be. As we step through the gateway into the
street, the man turns right about face and we are seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Halte! Quien vive?</em>&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advance, friends, and give the countersign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you see, I am a friar. I have been shriving a
condemned prisoner. You surely do not expect me to give the
countersign!&rdquo; said Carmen, going close up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, <em>padre</em>. But who is that with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pablo, the turnkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advance and give the countersign, Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baylen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong; it has been changed within the last ten minutes.
You must go back and get it, friend Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not worth the trouble. He is only seeing me to the
end of the street,&rdquo; pleaded Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not let him go another step without the
countersign,&rdquo; returned the sentry, doggedly. &ldquo;I am not
sure that I ought to let you go either, father. He has only to
ask&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden movement of Carmen&rsquo;s arm, a gleam of steel in the
darkness, the soldier&rsquo;s musket falls from his grasp, and with
a deep groan he sinks heavily on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, se&ntilde;or, or we shall be taken! Round the
corner! We must not run; that would attract attention. A sharp
walk. Good! Keep close to the wall. Two minutes more and we shall
be safe. A narrow escape! If the sentry had made you go back or
called the guard, all would have been lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it? Did you stab him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the heart. He has mounted guard for the last time. So
much the better. It is an enemy and a Spaniard the less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, Se&ntilde;or Carmen, I would rather kill my
enemies in fair fight than in cold blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also; but there are occasions. As likely as not this
soldier would have been in the firing party told off to shoot you
to-morrow morning. There would not have been much fair fight in
that. And had I not killed him, we should both have been tried by
drum-head court-martial, and shot or strangled to-night. This way.
Now, I defy them to catch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Carmen plunged into a heap of ruins by the wayside,
with the intricacies of which, despite the darkness, he appeared to
be quite familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody will disturb us here,&rdquo; he said at length,
pausing under the shadow of a broken wall. &ldquo;These are the
ruins of the Church of Alta Gracia, which, in its fall during the
great earthquake, killed several hundred worshippers. People say
they are haunted; after dark nobody will come near them. But we
must not stay many minutes. Take off the zambo&rsquo;s shirt and
trousers, and put on your shoes and stockings&mdash;there they
are&mdash;and I shall doff my cloak of religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make off with all speed and by devious
ways&mdash;though I think we have quite thrown our pursuers off the
scent&mdash;to a house in the outskirts belonging to a friend of
the cause, where we shall find horses, and start for the llanos
before the moon rises, and the hue and cry can be
raised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on circumstances. Four or five days,
perhaps. <em>Vamanos!</em> Time presses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We left the ruins at the side opposite to that at which we had
entered them, and after traversing several by-streets and narrow
lanes reached the open country, and walked on rapidly till we came
to a lonesome house in a large garden.</p>
<p>Carmen went up to the door, whistled softly, and knocked
thrice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; asked a voice from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salvador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this the gate of the <em>patio</em>, wide enough to admit a
man on horseback, was thrown open, and the next moment I was in the
arms of Se&ntilde;or Carera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the lion&rsquo;s mouth!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he
kissed me on both cheeks. &ldquo;I was dying of anxiety. But, thank
Heaven and the Holy Virgin, you are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have also to thank you and Se&ntilde;or Carmen; and I
do thank you with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more. We could not have done less. You were our
guest. You rendered us a great service. Had we let you perish
without an effort to save you, we should have been eternally
disgraced. But come in and refresh yourselves. Your stay here must
be brief, and we can talk while we eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we sat at table, Carmen told the story of my rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was well done,&rdquo; said our host, thoughtfully,
&ldquo;very well done. Yet I regret you had to kill the sentry. But
for that you might have had a little sleep, and started after
midnight. As it is, you must set off forthwith and get well on the
road before the news of the escape gets noised abroad. And
everything is ready. All your things are here, Se&ntilde;or
Fortescue. You can select what you want for the journey and leave
the rest in my charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my things here! How did you manage that, Se&ntilde;or
Carera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By sending a man, whom I could trust, in the character of
a messenger from the prison with a note to the <em>posadero</em>,
as from you, asking him to deliver your baggage and receipt your
bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very good of you, Se&ntilde;or Carera. A
thousand thanks. How much&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much! That is my affair. You are my guest, remember.
Your baggage is in the next room, and while you make your
preparations, I will see to the saddling of the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very few minutes sufficed to put on my riding boots, get my
pistols, and make up my scanty kit. When I went outside, the horses
were waiting in the <em>patio</em>, each of them held by a black
groom. Everything was in order. A <em>cobija</em> was strapped
behind either saddle, both of which were furnished with holsters
and bags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had some <em>tasajo</em> (dried beef) put in the
saddle-bags, as much as will keep you going three or four
days,&rdquo; said Se&ntilde;or Carera. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find
many hotels on the road. And you will want a sword, Mr. Fortescue.
Do me the favor to accept this as a souvenir of our friendship. It
is a fine Toledo blade, with a history. An ancestor of mine wore it
at the battle of Lepanto. It may bend but will never break, and has
an edge like a razor. I give it to you to be used against my
country&rsquo;s enemies, and I am sure you will never draw it
without cause, nor sheathe it without honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked my host warmly for his timely gift, and, as I buckled
the historic weapon to my side, glanced at the horse which he had
placed at my disposal. It was a beautiful flea-bitten gray, with a
small, fiery head, arched neck, sloping shoulders, deep chest,
powerful quarters, well-bent hocks, and &ldquo;clean&rdquo; shapely
legs&mdash;a very model of a horse, and as it seemed, in perfect
condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you may look at Pizarro as long as you like,
Se&ntilde;or Fortescue, and he is well worth looking at; but you
will never tire him,&rdquo; said Carera. &ldquo;What will you do if
you meet the patrol, Salvador?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evade them if we can, charge them if we
cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means the former, if possible, and then you may
not be pursued. And now, Se&ntilde;or, I trust you will not hold me
wanting in hospitality if I urge you to mount; but your lives are
in jeopardy, and there may be death in delay. Put out the lights,
men, and open the gates. <em>Adios</em>, Se&ntilde;or Fortescue!
<em>Adios</em>, my dear Salvador. We shall meet again in happier
times. God guard you, and bring you safe to your journey&rsquo;s
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then we rode forth into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better take to the open country at once, and
strike the road about a few miles farther on. It is rather risky,
for we shall have to get over several rifts made by the earthquake
and cross a stream with high banks. But if we take to the road
straightway, we are almost sure to meet a patrol. We may meet one
in any case; but the farther from the city the encounter takes
place, the greater will be our chance of getting
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know best. Lead on, and I will follow. Are these
rifts you speak of wide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are easily jumpable by daylight; but how we shall do
them in the dark, I don&rsquo;t know. However, these horses are as
nimble as cats, and almost as keen-sighted. I think, if we leave it
to them, they will carry us safely over. The sky is a little
clearer, too, and that will count in our favor. This
way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We sped on as swiftly and silently as the spectre horseman of
the story, for Venezuelan horses being unshod and their favorite
pace a gliding run (much less fatiguing for horse and rider than
the high trot of Europe) they move as noiselessly over grass as a
man in slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; cried Carmen, reining in his horse.
&ldquo;We are not far from the first grip. Don&rsquo;t you see
something like a black streak running across the grass? That is
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wide, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight or ten feet. Don&rsquo;t try to guide your horse.
He won&rsquo;t refuse. Let him have his head and take it in his own
way. Go first; my horse likes a lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pizarro went to the edge of the rift, stretched out his head as
if to measure the distance, and then, springing over as lightly as
a deer, landed safely on the other side. The next moment Carmen was
with me. After two or three more grips (all of unknown depth, and
one smelling strongly of sulphur) had been surmounted in the same
way, we came to the stream. The bank was so steep and slippery that
the horses had to slide down it on their haunches (after the manner
of South American horses). But having got in, we had to get out.
This proved no easy task, and it was only after we had floundered
in the brook for twenty minutes or more, that Carmen found a place
where he thought it might be possible to make our exit. And such a
place! We were forced to dismount, climb up almost on our hands and
knees, and let the horses scramble after us as they best could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the last of our difficulties,&rdquo; said Carmen,
as we got into our saddles. &ldquo;In ten minutes we strike the
road, and then we shall have a free course for several
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the patrols? Do you think we have given them
the slip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. They don&rsquo;t often come as far as
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reached the road at a point where it was level with the
fields; and a few miles farther on entered a defile, bounded on the
left by a deep ravine, on the right by a rocky height.</p>
<p>And then there occurred a startling phenomenon. As the moon rose
above the Silla of Caracas, the entire savanna below us seemed to
take fire, streams as of lava began to run up (not down) the sides
of the hills, throwing a lurid glare over the sleeping city, and
bringing into strong relief the rugged mountains which walled in
the plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, what is that!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the time of drought, and the peons are firing the
grass to improve the land,&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;I wish they
had not done it just now, though. However, it is, perhaps, quite as
well. If the light makes us more visible to others, it also makes
others more visible to us. Hark! What is that? Did you not hear
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. The neighing of a horse. Halt! Let us
listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The neighing of a horse and something more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men&rsquo;s voices and the rattle of accoutrements. The
patrol, after all. What shall we do? To turn back would be fatal.
The ravine is too deep to descend. Climbing those rocks is out of
the question. There is but one alternative&mdash;we must charge
right through them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many men does a patrol generally consist
of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes two, sometimes four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it not be a squadron on the march?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may. No matter. We must charge them, all the same.
Better die sword in hand than be garroted on the plaza. We have one
great advantage. We shall take these fellows by surprise. Let us
wait here in the shade, and the moment they round that corner, go
at them, full gallop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely spoken, when two dragoons came in sight,
then two more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four!&rdquo; murmured Carmen. &ldquo;The odds are not too
great. We shall do it. Are you ready? Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dragoons, surprised by our sudden appearance, pulled up and
stood stock-still, as if doubtful whether our intentions were
hostile or friendly; and we were at them almost before they had
drawn their swords.</p>
<p>As I charged the foremost Spaniard, his horse swerved from the
road, and rolled with his rider into the ravine. The second,
profiting by his comrade&rsquo;s disaster, gave us the slip and
galloped toward Caracas. This left us face to face with the other
two, and in little more than as many minutes I had run my man
through, and Carmen had hurled his to the ground with a cleft
skull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we should do it,&rdquo; he said as he sheathed
his sword. &ldquo;But before we ride on let us see who the fellows
are, for, &rsquo;pon my soul, they have not the looks of a patrol
from Caracas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Carmen dismounted and closely examined the
prostrate men&rsquo;s facings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Caramba!</em> They belong to the regiment of
Irun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember them. They were in Murillo&rsquo;s <em>corp
d&rsquo;arm&eacute;e</em> at Vittoria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they were at Vittoria now. Their headquarters are
at La Victoria! Worse luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there may be more of them. You suggested just now
the possibility of a squadron. How if we meet a
regiment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be in rather a bad scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in a bad scrape, <em>amigo mio</em>. Unless, I am
greatly mistaken the regiment of Irun, or, at any rate, a squadron
of it is on the march hitherward. If they started at sunrise and
rested during the heat of the day, this is about the time the
advance-guard would be here. Having no enemy to fear in these
parts, they would naturally break up into small detachments; there
has been no rain for weeks, and the dust raised by a large body of
horsemen is simply stifling. However, we may as well go forward to
certain death as go back to it. Besides, I hate going back in any
circumstances. And we have just one chance. We must hurry on and
ride for our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see that. We shall meet them all the
sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen made some reply which I failed to catch, and as the way
was rough and Pizarro required all my attention, I did not repeat
the question.</p>
<p>We passed rapidly up the brow, and when we reached more even
ground, put our horses to the gallop and went on, up hill and down
dale, until Carmen, uttering an exclamation, pulled his horse into
a walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can get down here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>We had reached a place where, although the mountain to our right
was still precipitous, the ravine seemed narrower and the sides
less steep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can,&rdquo; repeated Carmen. &ldquo;At any
rate, we must try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he dismounted, and leading his horse to the brink
of the ravine, incontinently disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on! It will do!&rdquo; he cried, dragging his horse
after him.</p>
<p>I followed with Pizarro, who missing his footing landed on his
head. As for myself, I rolled from top to bottom, the descent being
much steeper than I had expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XII" id="Ch_XII">Chapter XII.</a></h3>
<h2>Between Two Fires.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The ravine was filled with shrubs and trees, through which we
partly forced, partly threaded our way, until we reached a spot
where we were invisible from the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now off with your <em>cobija</em> and throw it over your
horse&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t
hear they won&rsquo;t neigh, and a single neigh might be our
ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to stay here until the troops have gone
past?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, I knew there was a good hiding-place hereabout,
and that if we reached it before the troops came up we should be
safe. If there be any more of them they will pass us in a few
minutes. Now, if you will hitch Pizarro to that tree&mdash;oh, you
have done so already. Good! Well, let us return to the road and
watch. We can hide in the grass, or behind the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We returned accordingly, and choosing a place where we could see
without being seen, we lay down and listened, exchanging now and
then a whispered remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; said Carmen, presently, putting his ear to
the ground. He had been so long on the war-path and lived so much
in the open air, that his senses were almost as acute as those of a
wild animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the hum of voices, the neighing of steeds, and the clang of
steel fell on my ear, and peering between the branches I could see
a group of shadows moving toward us. Then the shadows, taking form
and substance, became six horsemen. They passed within a few feet
of our hiding-place. We heard their talk, saw their faces in the
moonlight, and Carmen whispered that he could distinguish the
facings of their uniforms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I feared,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;the entire
regiment of Irun, shifting their quarters to Caracas. We are
prisoners here for an hour or two. Well, it is perhaps better to
have them behind than before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen when they find the bodies of the two
troopers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is precisely the question I am asking myself. But
not having met us they will naturally conclude that we have gone on
toward Caracas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless they are differently informed by the man who
escaped us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would be in any hurry to turn
back. He went off at a devil of a pace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might turn back for all that, when he recovered from
his scare. He could not help seeing that we were only two, and if
he informs the others they will know of a surety that we are hiding
in the ravine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then there would be a hunt. However, at the speed
they are riding it will take them an hour or more to reach the
scene of our skirmish, and then there is coming back. Everything
depends on how soon the last of them go by. If we have only a few
minutes start they will never overtake us, and once on the other
side of Los Teycos we shall be safe both from discovery and
pursuit. European cavalry are of no use in a Venezuelan forest; and
I don&rsquo;t think these Irun fellows have any
blood-hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood-hounds! You surely don&rsquo;t mean to say that the
Spaniards use blood-hounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean nothing else. General Griscelli, who holds the
chief command in the district of San Felipe, keeps a pack of
blood-hounds, which he got from Cuba. But, though a Spanish
general, Griscelli is not a Spaniard born. He is either a Corsican
or an Italian. I believe he was originally in the French army, and
when Dupont surrendered at Baylen he went over to the other side,
and accepted a commission from the King of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very good record, that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is not a good man. He outvies even the Spaniards
in cruelty. A very able general, though. He has given us a deal of
trouble. Down with your head! Here comes some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A whole troop this time. They pass in a cloud of dust. After a
short interval another detachment sweeps by; then another and
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gracias a Dios!</em> they are putting on more speed.
At this rate we shall soon be at liberty. But, <em>caramba</em>,
how they might have been trapped, Se&ntilde;or Fortescue! A few men
on that height hurling down rocks, the defile lined with
sharp-shooters, half a hundred of Mejia&rsquo;s <em>llaneros</em>
to cut off their retreat, and the regiment of Irun could be
destroyed to a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or taken prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there would be many prisoners,&rdquo;
said Carmen, grimly. &ldquo;These must almost be the last, I
think&mdash;they are. See! Here come the tag-rag and
bobtail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tag-rag and bob-tail consisted of a string of loaded mules
with their <em>arrieros</em>, a dozen women riding mules, and as
many men on foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get out of this hole while we may, and before any
of them come back. Once on the road and mounted, we shall at least
be able to fight; but down here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, this hole has served our turn well.
However, I quite agree with you that the best thing we can do is to
get out of it quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was more easily said than done. It was like climbing up a
precipice. Pizarro slipped back three times. Carmen&rsquo;s mare
did no better. In the end we had to dismount, fasten two lariats to
each saddle, and haul while the horses scrambled. A little help
goes a long way in such circumstances.</p>
<p>All this both made noise and caused delay, and it was with a
decided sense of relief that we found ourselves once more in the
saddle and <em>en route</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lost more time than I reckoned on,&rdquo; said
Carmen, as we galloped through the pass. &ldquo;If any of the
dragoons had turned back&mdash;However, they did not, and, as our
horses are both fresher than theirs and carry less weight, they
will have no chance of overtaking us if they do; and, as the whole
of the regiment has gone on, there is no chance of meeting any more
of them&mdash;<em>Caramba!</em> Halt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked, pulling up short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke too soon. More are coming. Don&rsquo;t you hear
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I see shadows in the distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shadows are soldiers, and we shall have to charge
them whether they be few or many, <em>amigo mio</em>; so say your
prayers and draw your Toledo. But first let us shake hands, we may
never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite ready to charge by your side, Carmen; but
would it not be better, think you, to try what a little strategy
will do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart, if you can suggest anything feasible.
I like a fight immensely&mdash;when the odds are not too
great&mdash;and I hope to die fighting. All the same, I have no
very strong desire to die at this particular moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither have I. So let us go on like peaceable
travellers, and the chances are that these men, taking for granted
that the others have let us pass, will not meddle with us. If they
do, we must make the best fight we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A happy thought! Let us act on it. If they ask any
questions I will answer. Your English accent might excite
suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party before us consisted of nine horsemen, several of whom
appeared to be officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Buene noche, se&ntilde;ores</em>,&rdquo; said Carmen,
so soon as we were within speaking distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Buene noche, se&ntilde;ores</em>. You have met the
troops, of course. How far are they ahead?&rdquo; asked one of the
officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main body are quite a league ahead by this time. The
pack-mules and <em>arrieros</em> passed us about fifteen minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gracias!</em> Who are you, and whither may you be
wending, se&ntilde;ores?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Sancho Mencar, at your service, <em>se&ntilde;or
coronel</em>, a Government messenger, carrying despatches to
General Salazar, at La Victoria. My companion is Se&ntilde;or
Tesco, a merchant, who is journeying to the same place on
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! you can go on. You will meet two troopers who are
bringing on a prisoner. Do me the favor to tell them to make
haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, <em>se&ntilde;or coronel. Adios,
se&ntilde;ores</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Adio se&ntilde;ores.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that we rode on our respective ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two troopers and prisoner,&rdquo; said Carmen,
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are more of them, after all! How many, I wonder?
If this prisoner be a patriot we must rescue him, se&ntilde;or
Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart&mdash;if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only two troopers! You and I are a match for
six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. But we don&rsquo;t know that the two are not
followed by a score! There seems to be no end of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. If there were the colonel would
have asked us to tell them also to hurry up. But we shall soon find
out. When we meet the fellows we will speak them fair and ask a few
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later we met them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Buene noche, se&ntilde;ores!</em>&rdquo; said Carmen,
riding forward. &ldquo;We bring a message from the colonel. He bids
you make haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All very fine. But how can we make haste when we are
hampered by this rascal? I should like to blow his brains
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This rascal&rdquo; was the prisoner, a big powerful
fellow who seemed to be either a zambo or a negro. His arms were
bound to his side, and he walked between the troopers, to whose
saddles he was fastened by two stout cords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you blow his brains out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we should get into trouble. He is the
colonel&rsquo;s slave, and therefore valuable property. We have
tried dragging him along; but the villain throws himself down, and
might get a limb broken, so all we can do is prod him occasionally
with the points of our sabres; but he does not seem to mind us in
the least. We have tried swearing; we might as well whistle. Make
haste, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very hard case, I am sure. I sympathize with you,
se&ntilde;ores. Is the man a runaway that you have to take such
care of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just it. He ran away and rambled for months in
the forest; and if he had not stolen back to La Victoria and been
betrayed by a woman, he would never have been caught. After that,
the colonel would not trust him at large; but he thinks that at
Caracas he will have him safe. And now, se&ntilde;ores, with your
leave we must go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! You are the last, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are; curse it! The main body must be a league ahead by
this time, and we shall not reach Caracas for hours.
<em>Adios!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us rescue the poor devil!&rdquo; I whispered to
Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means. One moment, se&ntilde;ores; I beg your
pardon&mdash;now, Fortescue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that we placed our horses across the road, whipped out
our pistols and pointed them at the troopers&rsquo; heads, to their
owners&rsquo; unutterable surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are sorry to inconvenience you, se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo;
said my companion, politely; &ldquo;but we are going to release
this slave, and we have need of your horses. Unbuckle your swords,
throw them on the ground, and dismount. No hesitation, or you are
dead men! Shall we treat them as they proposed to treat the slave,
Se&ntilde;or Fortescue? Blow out their brains? It will be safer,
and save us a deal of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! That would be murder. Let them go. They can do no
harm. It is impossible for them to overtake the, others on
foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the soldiers, having the fear of being shot before
them, had dismounted and laid down their weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said Carmen, pointing northward, and they
went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo; (to the prisoner whose bonds I was
cutting with my sword).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they call me Jos&eacute;. In my own country I was
called Gahra&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be Gahra, then. It is less common than
Jos&eacute;. Every other peon in the country is called Jos&eacute;.
You are a native of Africa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Si, se&ntilde;or.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came you hither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was taken to Cuba in a slave-ship, brought to this
country by General Salazar, and sold by him to Colonel
Canimo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no great love for the Spaniards, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gahra pointed to his arms which had been chafed by the rope till
they were raw, and showed us his back which bore the marks of
recent stripes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against the Spaniards? Only give me the chance, and you
shall see,&rdquo; answered the negro in a voice of intense
hate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us, and you shall have many chances. Mount one
of those horses and lead the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gahra mounted, and we moved on.</p>
<p>We were now at the beginning of a stiff ascent. The road, which
though undulating had risen almost continuously since we left
Caracas, was bordered with richly colored flowers and shrubs, and
bounded on either side by deep forests. Night was made glorious by
the great tropical moon, which shone resplendent under a purple sky
gilding the tree-tops and lighting us on our way. Owing to the
nature of the ground we could not see far before us, but the
backward view, with its wood-crowned heights, deep ravines, and
sombre mountains looming in the distance, was fairy-like and
fantastic, and the higher we rose the more extensive it became.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a long hill?&rdquo; I asked Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very. An affair of half an hour, at least, at this speed;
and we cannot go faster,&rdquo; he answered, as he turned half
round in his saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you looking backward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see whether we are followed. We lost much time in the
<em>quebrado</em>, and we have lost more since. Have you good eyes,
Gahara? Born Africans generally have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. My name, Gahra Dahra, signifies Dahra, the keen
sighted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it. Be good enough to look round
occasionally, and if you see anything let us know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had nearly reached the summit of the rise when the negro
uttered an exclamation and turned his horse completely round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Carmen and myself, following his
example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see figures on the brow of yonder hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see more than I can, and I have not bad eyes,&rdquo;
said Carmen, looking intently. &ldquo;What are they like, those
figures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I cannot make out yet. They are many; they move; and
every minute they grow bigger! That is all I can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite enough. The bodies of the two troopers have
been found, the alarm has been given, and we are pursued. But they
won&rsquo;t overtake us. They have that hill to descend, this to
mount; and our horses are better than theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going far, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; inquired
Gahra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the llanos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Los Teycos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We shall easily steal through Los Teycos, and I know
of a place in the forest beyond, where we can hide during the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me for venturing to contradict you, se&ntilde;or;
but I fear you will not find it very easy to steal through Los
Teycos. For three days it has been held by a company of infantry
and all the outlets are strictly guarded. No civilian unfurnished
with a safe conduct from the captain-general is allowed to
pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Caramba!</em> We are between two fires, it seems.
Well, we must make a dash for it. The sentries cannot stop us, and
we can gallop through before they turn out the guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horses will be very tired by that time, se&ntilde;or,
and the troopers can get fresh mounts at Los Teycos. But I know a
way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian trail! Do you know the Indian
trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I know the Indian trail, and I can take you to
a place in the forest where there is grass and water and game, and
we shall be safe from pursuit as long as we like to
stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two leagues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Lead on in heaven&rsquo;s name. You are a treasure,
Gahra Dahra. In rescuing you from those ruffianly Spaniards we did
ourselves, as well as you, a good turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our pursuers, who numbered a full score, could now be distinctly
seen, but in a few minutes we lost sight of them. After a sharp
ride of half an hour, the negro called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place. Here we turn off,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! I see nothing but the almost dry bed of a
torrent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better. We shall make no footmarks,&rdquo;
said Carmen. &ldquo;Go on, Gahra. But first of all turn that led
horse adrift. Are you sure this place you speak of is unknown to
the Spaniards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite. It is known only to a few wandering Indians and
fugitive slaves. We can stay here till sunrise. It is impossible to
follow the Indian trail by night, even with such a moon as
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After we had partly ridden, partly walked (for we were several
times compelled to dismount) about a mile along the bed of the
stream, which was hemmed in between impenetrable walls of tall
trees and dense undergrowth, Gahra, who was leading, called out:
&ldquo;This way!&rdquo; and vanished into what looked like a hole,
but proved to be a cleft in the bank so overhung by vegetation as
to be well-nigh invisible.</p>
<p>It was the entrance to a passage barely wide enough to admit a
horse and his rider, yet as light as a star-gemmed mid-night, for
the leafy vault above us was radiant with fireflies, gleaming like
diamonds in the dark hair of a fair woman.</p>
<p>But even with this help it was extremely difficult to force our
way through the tangled undergrowth, which we had several times to
attack, sword in hand, and none of us were sorry when Gahra
announced that we had reached the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Por todos los santos!</em> But this is
fairyland!&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen, who was just before me.
&ldquo;I never saw anything so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might well say so. We were on the shore of a mountain-tarn,
into whose clear depths the crescent moon, looking calmly down, saw
its image reflected as in a silver mirror. Lilies floated on its
waters, ferns and flowering shrubs bent over them, the air was
fragrant with sweet smells, and all around uprose giant trees with
stems as round and smooth as the granite columns of a great
cathedral; and, as it seemed in that dim religious light, high
enough to support the dome of heaven.</p>
<p>I was so lost in admiration of this marvellous scene that my
companions had unsaddled and were leading their horses down to the
water before I thought of dismounting from mine.</p>
<p>Apart from the beauty of the spot, we could have found none more
suitable for a bivouac! We were in safety and our horses in clover,
and, tethering them with the lariats, we left them to graze. Gahra
gathered leaves and twigs and kindled a fire, for the air at that
height was fresh, and we were lightly clad. We cooked our
<em>tasajo</em> on the embers, and after smoking the calumet of
peace, rolled ourselves in our <em>cobijas</em>, laid our heads on
our saddles, and slept the sleep of the just.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XIII" id="Ch_XIII">Chapter XIII.</a></h3>
<h2>On the Llanos.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Only a moment ago the land had been folded in the mantle of
darkness. Now, a flaming eye rises from the ground at some
immeasurable distance, like an outburst of volcanic fire. It grows
apace, chasing away the night and casting a ruddy glow on, as it
seems, a vast and waveless sea, as still as the painted ocean of
the poem, as silent as death, a sea without ships and without life,
mournful and illimitable, and as awe-inspiring and impressive as
the Andes or the Alps.</p>
<p>So complete is the illusion that did I not know we were on the
verge of the llanos I should be tempted to believe that
supernatural agency had transported us while we slept to the coasts
of the Caribbean Sea or the yet more distant shores of the Pacific
Ocean.</p>
<p>Six days are gone by since we left our bivouac by the
mountain-tarn: three we have wandered in the woods under the
guidance of Gahra, three sought Mejia and his guerillas, who, being
always on the move, are hard to find. Last night we reached the
range of hills which form, as it were, the northern coast-line of
the vast series of savannas which stretch from the tropics to the
Straits of Magellan; and it is now a question whether we shall
descend to the llanos or continue our search in the sierra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was there I left him,&rdquo; said Carmen, pointing to
a <em>quebrada</em> some ten miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we were yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and he said he would be either there or hereabout
when I returned, and I am quite up to time. But Mejia takes sudden
resolves sometimes. He may have gone to beat up Griselli&rsquo;s
quarters at San Felipe, or be making a dash across the llanos in
the hope of surprising the fortified post of Tres
Cruces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do then; wait here until he comes
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or ride out on the llanos in the direction of Tres
Cruces. If we don&rsquo;t meet Mejia and his people we may hear
something of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am for the llanos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. We will go thither. But we shall have to be
very circumspect. There are loyalist as well as patriot guerillas
roaming about. They say that Morales has collected a force of three
or four thousand, mostly Indios, and they are all so much alike
that unless you get pretty close it is impossible to distinguish
patriots from loyalists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is room to run if we cannot fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, plenty of room,&rdquo; laughed Carmen. &ldquo;But as
for fighting&mdash;loyalist guerillas are not quite the bravest of
the brave, yet I don&rsquo;t think we three are quite a match for
fifty of them, and we are not likely to meet fewer, if we meet any.
But let us adventure by all means. Our horses are fresh, and we can
either return to the sierra or spend the night on the llanos, as
may be most expedient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later we were mounted, and an hour&rsquo;s easy
riding brought us to the plain. It was as pathless as the ocean,
yet Carmen, guided by the sun, went on as confidently as if he had
been following a beaten track. The grass was brown and the soil
yellow; particles of yellow dust floated in the air; the few trees
we passed were covered with it, and we and our horses were soon in
a like condition. Nothing altered as we advanced; sky and earth
were ever the same; the only thing that moved was a cloud, sailing
slowly between us and the sun, and when Carmen called a halt on the
bank of a nearly dried-up stream, it required an effort to realize
that since we left our bivouac in the hills we had ridden twenty
miles in a direct line. Hard by was a deserted <em>hatto</em>, or
cattle-keeper&rsquo;s hut, where we rested while our horses
grazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sign of Mejia yet,&rdquo; observed Carmen, as he
lighted his cigar with a burning-glass. &ldquo;Shall we go on
toward Tres Cruces, or return to our old camping-ground in the
hills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am for going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. But we must keep a sharp lookout. We shall be on
dangerous ground after we have crossed the Tio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the Tio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; (pointing to the attenuated stream near
us).</p>
<p>&ldquo;That! I thought the Tio was a river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, and a big one in the rainy season, as you may
have an opportunity of seeing. I wish we could hear something of
Mejia. But there is nobody of whom we can inquire. The country is
deserted; the herdsmen have all gone south, to keep out of the way
of guerillas and brigands, all of whom look on cattle as common
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody comes!&rdquo; said Gahra, who was always on the
lookout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen, springing to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep out of sight till he draws near, else he may sheer
off; and I should like to have a speech of him. He may be able to
tell us something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger came unconcernedly on, and as he stopped in the
middle of the river to let his horse drink, we had a good look at
him. He was well mounted, carried a long spear and a
<em>macheto</em> (a broad, sword-like knife, equally useful for
slitting windpipes and felling trees), and wore a broad-brimmed
hat, shirt, trousers, and a pair of spurs (strapped to his naked
feet).</p>
<p>As he resumed his journey across the river, we all stepped out
of the <em>hatto</em> and gave him the traditional greeting,
&ldquo;<em>Buenas dias, se&ntilde;or.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, looking up in alarm, showed a decided disposition to
make off, but Carmen spoke him kindly, offered him a cigar, and
said that all we wanted was a little information. We were peaceful
travellers, and would much like to know whether the country beyond
the Tio was free from guerillas.</p>
<p>The stranger eyed us suspiciously, and then, after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, said that he had heard that Mejia was
&ldquo;on the war-path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say he was at Tres Cruces three days ago; and there
has been fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are any of Morale&rsquo;s people also on the
war-path?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is more than I can tell you, se&ntilde;ores. It is
very likely; but as you are peaceful travellers, I am sure no one
will molest you. <em>Adoiso, se&ntilde;ores.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the man gave his horse a sudden dig with his
spurs, and went off at a gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a discourteous beggar he is!&rdquo; exclaimed
Carmen, angrily. &ldquo;If it would not take too much out of my
mare I would ride after him and give him a lesson in
politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he was intentionally uncivil. He
seemed afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently. He did not know what we were, and feared to
commit himself. However, we have learned something. We are on
Mejia&rsquo;s track. He was at Tres Cruces three days since, and if
we push on we may fall in with him before sunset, or, at any rate,
to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not possible that this man may have been purposely
deceiving us, or be himself misinformed?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite. But as we had already decided to go on it does not
matter a great deal whether he is right or wrong. I I think,
though, he knew more about the others than he cared to tell. All
the more reason for keeping a sharp lookout and riding
slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So as to save our horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. We may have to ride for our lives before the sun
goes down. And now let us mount and march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our course was almost due west, and the sun being now a little
past the zenith, its ardent rays&mdash;which shone right in our
faces&mdash;together with the reverberations from the ground, made
the heat almost insupportable. The stirrup-irons burned our feet;
speech became an effort; we sat in our saddles, perspiring and
silent; our horses, drooping their heads, settled into a listless
and languid walk. The glare was so trying that I closed my eyes and
let Pizarro go as he would. Open them when I might, the outlook was
always the same, the same yellow earth and blue sky, the same
lifeless, interminable plain, the same solitary sombrero palms
dotting the distant horizon.</p>
<p>This went on for an hour or two, and I think I must have fallen
into a doze, for when, roused by a shout from Gahra, I once more
opened my eyes the sun was lower and the heat less intense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it,&rdquo; asked Carmen, who, like myself, had
been half asleep. &ldquo;I see nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cloud of dust that moves&mdash;there!&rdquo;
(pointing).</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; shading his eyes and looking again.
&ldquo;Coming this way, too. Behind that cloud is a body of
horsemen. Be they friends or enemies&mdash;Mejia and his people or
loyalist guerillas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is more than I can say, se&ntilde;or. Mejia, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also. But hope is not certainty, and until we can make
sure we had better hedge away toward the north, so as to be nearer
the hills in case we have to run for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think we had better make for the hills in that
case?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly. Mejia is sure to return thither, and
Morale&rsquo;s men are much less likely to follow us far in that
direction than south or east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, still riding leisurely, we diverged a little to the right,
keeping the cloud-veiled horsemen to our left. By this measure we
should (if they proved to be enemies) prevent them from getting
between us and the hills, and thereby cutting off our best line of
retreat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the cloud grew bigger. Before long we could
distinguish those whom it had hidden, without, however, being able
to decide whether they were friends or foes.</p>
<p>Carmen thought they numbered at least two hundred, and there
might be more behind. But who they were he could, as yet, form no
idea.</p>
<p>The nearer we approached them the greater became our excitement
and surprise. A few minutes and we should either be riding for our
lives or surrounded by friends. We looked to the priming of our
pistols, tightened our belts and our horses&rsquo; girths, wiped
the sweat and dust from our faces, and, while hoping for the best,
prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They see us!&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen. &ldquo;I cannot
quite make them out, though. I fear&hellip;. But let us ride
quietly on. The secret will soon be revealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen horsemen had detached themselves from the main body with
the intention, as might appear, of intercepting our retreat in
every direction. Four went south, four north, and four moved slowly
round to our rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had we not better push on?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;This
looks very like a hostile demonstration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it does. But we must find out&mdash;And there is no
hurry. We shall only have the four who are coming this way to deal
with, the others are out of the running. All the same, we may as
well draw a little farther to the right, so as to give them a
longer gallop and get them as far from the main body as may
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four were presently near enough to be distinctly seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enemies! <em>Vamonos!</em>&rdquo; cried Carmen, after he
had scanned their faces. &ldquo;But not too fast. If they think we
are afraid and our horses tired they will follow us without waiting
for the others, and perhaps give us an opportunity of teaching them
better manners. Your horse is the fleetest, se&ntilde;or Fortescue.
You had better, perhaps, ride last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this hint I acted; and when the four guerillas saw that I was
lagging behind they redoubled their efforts to overtake me, but
whenever they drew nearer than I liked, I let Pizarro out, thereby
keeping their horses, which were none too fresh, continually on the
stretch. The others were too far in the rear to cause us concern.
We had tested the speed of their horses and knew that we could
leave them whenever we liked.</p>
<p>After we had gone thus about a couple of miles Carmen slackened
speed so as to let me come up with him and Gahra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have five minutes to spare,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Shall we stop them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded assent, whereupon we checked our horses, and wheeling
around, looked our pursuers in the face. This brought them up
short, and I thought they were going to turn tail, but after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation they lowered their lances and came on
albeit at no great speed, receiving as they did so a point-blank
volley from our pistols, which emptied one of their saddles. Then
we drew our swords and charged, but before we could get to close
quarters the three men sheered off to the right and left, leaving
their wounded comrade to his fate. It did not suit our purpose to
follow them, and we were about to go on, when we noticed that the
other guerillas, who a few minutes previously were riding hotly
after us, had ceased their pursuit, and were looking round in
seeming perplexity. The main body had, moreover, come to a halt,
and were closing up and facing the other way. Something had
happened. What could it be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another cloud of dust,&rdquo; said Gahra, pointing to the
north-west.</p>
<p>So there was, and moving rapidly. Had our attention been less
taken up with the guerillas this new portent would not so long have
escaped us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mejia! I&rsquo;ll wager ten thousand piasters that behind
that cloud are Mejia and his braves,&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen,
excitedly. <em>Hijo de Dios!</em> Won&rsquo;t they make mince-meat
of the Spaniard? How I wish I were with them! Shall we go back
Se&ntilde;or Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think! I am sure. I can see the gleam of their spears
through the dust. By all means, let us join them. The Spaniards
have too much on their hands just now to heed us. But I must have a
spear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that Carmen slipped from his horse and picked up the
lance of the fallen guerilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you prefer a spear to a sword?&rdquo; I asked, as we
rode on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like both, but in a charge on the llanos I prefer a
spear decidedly. Yet I dare say you will do better with the weapon
to which you have been most accustomed. If you ward off or evade
the first thrust and get to your opponent&rsquo;s left rear you
will have him at your mercy. Our <em>llaneros</em> are indifferent
swordsmen; but once turn your back and you are doomed. Hurrah!
There is Mejia, leading his fellows on. Don&rsquo;t you see him?
The tall man on the big horse. Forward, se&ntilde;ors! We may be in
time for the encounter even yet.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Caught.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>A smart gallop of a few minutes brought us near enough to see
what was going on, though as we had to make a considerable
<em>d&eacute;tour</em> in order to avoid the Spaniards, we were
just too late for the charge, greatly to Carmen&rsquo;s
disappointment.</p>
<p>In numbers the two sides were pretty equal, the strength of each
being about a thousand men. Their tactics were rather those of
Indian braves than regular troops. The patriots were, however, both
better led and better disciplined than their opponents, and fought
with a courage and a resolution that on their native plains would
have made them formidable foes for the &ldquo;crackest&rdquo; of
European cavalry.</p>
<p>The encounter took place when we were within a few hundred yards
of Mejia&rsquo;s left flank. It was really a charge in line, albeit
a very broken line, every man riding as hard as he could and
fighting for his own land. All were armed with spears, the longest,
as I afterward learned, being wielded by Colombian
<em>gauchos</em>. These portentous weapons, fully fourteen feet
long, were held in both hands, the reins being meanwhile placed on
the knees, and the horses guided by voice and spur. The Spaniards
seemed terribly afraid of them, as well they might be, for the
Colombian spears did dire execution. Few missed their mark, and I
saw more than one trooper literally spitted and lifted clean out of
his saddle.</p>
<p>Mejia, distinguishable by his tall stature, was in the thick of
the fray. After the first shock he threw away his spear, and
drawing a long two-handed sword, which he carried at his back, laid
about like a <em>coeur-de-lion</em>. The combat lasted only a few
minutes, and though we were too late to contribute to the victory
we were in time to take part in the pursuit.</p>
<p>It was a scene of wild confusion and excitement; the Spaniards
galloping off in all directions, singly and in groups, making no
attempt to rally, yet when overtaken, fighting to the last,
Mejia&rsquo;s men following them with lowered lances and wild
cries, managing their fiery little horses with consummate ease, and
<em>making no prisoners</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a chance for us; let us charge these
fellows!&rdquo; shouted Carmen, as eight or nine of the enemy rode
past us in full retreat; and without pausing for a reply he went
off at a gallop, followed by Gahra and myself; for although I had
no particular desire to attack men who were flying for their lives
and to whom I knew no quarter would be given, it was impossible to
hold back when my comrades were rushing into danger. Had the
Spaniards been less intent on getting away it would have fared ill
with us. As it was, we were all wounded. Gahra got a thrust through
the arm, Carmen a gash in the thigh; and as I gave one fellow the
point in his throat his spear pierced my hat and cut my head. If
some of the patriots had not come to the rescue our lives would
have paid the forfeit of our rashness.</p>
<p>The incident was witnessed by Mejia himself, who, when he
recognized Carmen, rode forward, greeted us warmly and remarked
that we were just in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be too late,&rdquo; answered Carmen, discontentedly,
as he twisted a handkerchief round his wounded thigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much; and you have done your share. That was a bold
charge you made. And your friends? I don&rsquo;t think I have the
pleasure of knowing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen introduced us, and told him who I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted to make your acquaintance,
se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said, graciously, &ldquo;and I will give
you of my best; but I can offer you only rough fare and plenty of
fighting. Will that content you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed, and answered that I desired nothing better. The
guerilla leader was a man of striking appearance, tall, spare, and
long limbed. The contour of his face was Indian; he had the
deep-set eyes, square jaws, and lank hair of the abonguil race. But
his eyes were blue, his hair was flaxen, and his skin as fair as
that of a pure-blooded Teuton. Mejia, as I subsequently heard, was
the son of a German father and a mestizma mother, and prouder of
his Indian than his European ancestry. It was probably for this
reason that he preferred being called Mejia rather than Morgenstern
y Mejia, his original appellation. His hereditary hatred of the
Spaniards, inflamed by a sense of personal wrong, was his ruling
passion. He spared none of the race (being enemies) who fell into
his hands. Natives of the country, especially those with Indian
blood in their veins, he treated more mercifully&mdash;when his men
would let him, for they liked killing even more than they liked
fighting, and had an unpleasant way of answering a remonstrance
from their officers with a thrust from their spears.</p>
<p>Mejia owed his ascendancy over them quite as much to his good
fortune in war as to his personal prowess and resolute
character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were to lose a battle they would probably take my
life, and I should certainly have to resign my command,&rdquo; he
observed, when we were talking the matter over after the pursuit
(which, night being near, was soon abandoned); &ldquo;and a
<em>llanero</em> leader must lead&mdash;no playing the general or
watching operations from the rear&mdash;or it will be the worse for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand; he must be first or nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, first or nowhere; and they will brook no punishment
save death. If a man disobeys me I either let it pass or shoot him
out of hand, according to circumstances. If I were to strike a man
or order him under arrest, the entire force would either mutiny or
disband. <em>Si se&ntilde;or</em>, my <em>llaneros</em> are wild
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked it. Most of them wore only a ragged shirt over
equally ragged trousers. Their naked feet were thrust into rusty
stirrups. Some rode bare-backed, and there were among them men of
every breed which the country produced; mestizoes, mulattoes,
zambos, quadroons, negroes, and Indios, but all born
<em>gauchos</em> and <em>llaneros</em>, hardy and in high
condition, and well skilled in the use of lasso and spear. They
were volunteers, too, and if their chief failed to provide them
with a sufficiency of fighting and plunder, they had no hesitation
in taking themselves off without asking for leave of absence.</p>
<p>When Mejia heard that a British force was being raised for
service against the Spaniards, he was greatly delighted, and
offered me on the spot a command in his &ldquo;army,&rdquo; or,
alternatively, the position of his principal aide-de-camp. I
preferred the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have decided wisely, and I thank you,
<em>se&ntilde;or coronel</em>. The advice and assistance of a
soldier who has seen so much of war as you have will be very
valuable and highly esteemed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reminded the chief that, in the British army, I had held no
higher rank than that of lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matters that? I have made myself a general, and I
make you a colonel. Who is there to say me nay?&rdquo; he demanded,
proudly.</p>
<p>Though much amused by this summary fashion of conferring
military rank, I kept a serious countenance, and, after
congratulating General Mejia on his promotion and thanking him for
mine, I said that I should do my best to justify his
confidence.</p>
<p>We bivouacked on the banks of a stream some ten miles from the
scene of our encounter with the loyalists. On our way thither,
Mejia told us that he had taken and destroyed Tres Cruces, and was
now contemplating an attack on General Griscelli at San Felipe, as
to which he asked my opinion.</p>
<p>I answered that, as I knew nothing either of the defense of San
Felipe or of the strength and character of the force commanded by
General Griscelli, I could give none. On this, Mejia informed me
that the place was a large village and military post, defended by
earthworks and block-houses, and that the force commanded by
Griscelli consisted of about twenty-five hundred men, of whom about
half were regulars, half native auxiliaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he any artillery?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten pieces of position, but no
field-guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor any infantry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here. But my colleague, General Estero, is at present
organizing a force which I dare say will exceed two thousand men,
and he promises to join me in the course of a week or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is better, certainly. Nevertheless, I fear that with
one thousand horse and two thousand foot, and without artillery,
you will not find it easy to capture a strong place, armed with ten
guns and held by twenty-five hundred men, of whom half are
regulars. If I were you I would let San Felipe alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mejia frowned. My advice was evidently not to his liking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you, <em>se&ntilde;or coronel</em>&rdquo; he
said, arrogantly, &ldquo;our patriot soldiers are equal to any in
the world, regular or irregular. And, don&rsquo;t you see that the
very audacity of the enterprise counts in our favor? The last thing
Griscelli expects is an attack. We shall find him unprepared and
take him by surprise. That man has done us a great deal of harm. He
hangs every patriot who falls into his hands, and I have made up my
mind to hang him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this there was nothing more to be said, and I held my
peace. I soon found, moreover, that albeit Mejia often made a show
of consulting me he had no intention of accepting my advice, and
that all his officers (except Carmen) and most of his men regarded
me as a <em>gringo</em> (foreign interloper) and were envious of my
promotion, and jealous of my supposed influence with the
general.</p>
<p>We bivouacked in a valley on the verge of the llanos, and the
next few days were spent in raiding cattle and preparing
<em>tasajo</em>. We had also another successful encounter with a
party of Morale&rsquo;s guerillas. This raised Mejia&rsquo;s
spirits to the highest point, and made him more resolute than ever
to attack San Felipe. But when I saw General Estero&rsquo;s
infantry my misgivings as to the outcome of the adventure were
confirmed. His men, albeit strong and sturdy and full of fight,
were badly disciplined and indifferently armed, their officers
extremely ignorant and absurdly boastful and confident. Estero
himself, though like Mejia, a splendid patriotic leader, was no
general, and I felt sure that unless we caught Griscelli asleep we
should find San Felipe an uncommonly hard nut to crack. I need
hardly say, however, that I kept this opinion religiously to
myself. Everybody was so confident and cock-sure, that the mere
suggestion of a doubt would have been regarded as treason and
probably exposed me to danger.</p>
<p>A march of four days partly across the llanos, partly among the
wooded hills by which they were bounded, brought us one morning to
a suitable camping-ground, within a few miles of San Felipe, and
Mejia, who had assumed the supreme command, decided that the attack
should take place on the following night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will surely reconnoitre first, General Mejia,&rdquo;
I ventured to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be the use? Estero and I know the place.
However, if you and Carmen like to go and have a look you
may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen was nothing loath, and two hours before sunset we saddled
our horses and set out. I could speak more freely to him than to
any of the others, and as we rode on I remarked how carelessly the
camp was guarded. There were no proper outposts, and instead of
being kept out of sight in the <em>quebrado</em>, the men were
allowed to come and go as they liked. Nothing would be easier than
for a treacherous soldier to desert and give information to the
enemy which might not only ruin the expedition but bring
destruction on the army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Fortescue, I cannot agree to that. There are no
traitors among us,&rdquo; said my companion, warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not. Yet how can you guarantee that among two or
three thousand men there is not a single rascal! In war, you should
leave nothing to chance. And even though none of the fellows desert
it is possible that some of them may wander too far away and get
taken prisoners, which would be quite as bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it would give Griscelli warning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, and if he is an enterprising general he would
not wait to be attacked. Instead of letting us surprise him he
would surprise us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Caramba!</em> So he would. And Griscelli is an
enterprising general. We must mention this to Mejia when we get
back, <em>amigo mio</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may, if you like. I am tired of giving advice which
is never heeded,&rdquo; I said, rather bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, certainly, and then whatever befalls I shall have
a clear conscience. Mejia is one of the bravest men I know. It is a
pity he is so self-opinionated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to make a general a man must have something more
than bravery. He must have brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen knew the country we were in thoroughly, and at his
suggestion we went a roundabout way through the woods in order to
avoid coming in contact with any of Griscelli&rsquo;s people. On
reaching a hill overlooking San Felipe we tethered our horses in a
grove of trees where they were well hidden, and completed the
ascent on foot. Then, lying down, and using a field-glass lent us
by Mejia, we made a careful survey of the place and its
surroundings.</p>
<p>San Felipe, a picturesque village of white houses with thatched
roofs, lay in a wide well-cultivated valley, looking south, and
watered by a shallow stream which in the rainy season was probably
a wide river. At each corner of the village, well away from the
houses, was a large block-house, no doubt pierced for musketry.
From one block-house to another ran an earthen parapet with a
ditch, and on each parapet were mounted three guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what think you of San Felipe, and our chances of
taking it?&rdquo; asked Carmen, after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think its defences are very formidable. A
single mortar on that height to the east would make the place
untenable in an hour; set it on fire in a dozen places. It is all
wood. But to attempt its capture with a force of infantry
numerically inferior to the garrison will be a very hazardous
enterprise indeed, and barring miraculously good luck on the one
side or miraculously ill luck on the other cannot possibly succeed,
I should say. No, Carmen, I don&rsquo;t think we shall be in San
Felipe to-morrow night, or any night, just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how if a part of the garrison be absent? Hist! Did
not you hear something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the crackling of a branch. Some wild animal,
probably. I wonder whether there are any jaguars
hereabout&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if the garrison be weak and the sentries sleep it is
quite possible we may take the place by a rush. But, on the other
hand, it is equally possible that Griscelli may have got wind of
our intention, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again! Something more than a wild animal this
time, Fortescue,&rdquo; exclaims Carmen, springing to his feet.</p>
<p>I follow his example; but the same instant a dozen men spring
from the bushes, and before we can offer any resistance, or even
draw our swords, we are borne to the ground and despite our
struggles, our arms pinioned to our sides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XV" id="Ch_XV">Chapter XV.</a></h3>
<h2>An Old Enemy.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Our captors were Spanish soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be good enough to rise and accompany us to San Felipe,
se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said the non-commissioned officer in command
of the detachment, &ldquo;and if you attempt to escape I shall blow
your brains out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Dios mio!</em> It serves us right for not keeping a
better lookout,&rdquo; said Carmen, with a laugh which I thought
sounded rather hollow. &ldquo;We shall be in San Felipe sooner than
we expected, that is all. Lead on, sergeant; we have a dozen good
reasons for not trying to escape, to say nothing of our strait
waistcoats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon we were marched down the hill and taken to San Felipe,
two men following with our horses, from which and other
circumstances I inferred that we had been under observation ever
since our arrival in the neighborhood. The others were doubtless
under observation also; and at the moment I thought less of our own
predicament (in view of the hanging propensities of General
Griscelli, a decidedly unpleasant one) than of the terrible
surprise which awaited Mejia and his army, for, as I quickly
perceived, the Spaniards were quite on the alert, and fully
prepared for whatever might befall. The place swarmed with
soldiers; sentries were pacing to and fro on the parapets, gunners
furbishing up their pieces, and squads of native auxiliaries being
drilled on a broad savanna outside the walls.</p>
<p>Many of the houses were mere huts&mdash;roofs on stilts; others,
&ldquo;wattle and dab;&rdquo; a few, brown-stone. To the most
imposing of these we were conducted by our escort. Above the
doorway, on either side of which stood a sentry, was an
inscription: &ldquo;Headquarters: General Griscelli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant asked one of the sentries if the general was in,
and receiving an answer in the affirmative he entered, leaving us
outside. Presently he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general will see you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;be good
enough to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went in, and after traversing a wide corridor were ushered
into a large room, where an officer in undress uniform sat writing
at a big table. Several other officers were lounging in
easy-chairs, and smoking big cigars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the prisoners, general,&rdquo; announced our
conductor.</p>
<p>The man at the table, looking up, glanced first at Carmen, then
at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Caramba!</em>&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a stare of
surprise, &ldquo;you and I have met before, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned the stare with interest, for though I recognized him
I could hardly believe my own eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the field of Salamanca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. You are the English officer who behaved so
insolently and got me reprimanded.&rdquo; (This in French.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did no more than my duty. It was you that behaved
insolently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care what you say, se&ntilde;or, or <em>por
Dios</em>&mdash;There is no English general to whom you can appeal
for protection now. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much good, I fear. Your men brought me: I had not the
least desire to come, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were caught on the hill yonder, surveying the town
through a glass, and Sergeant Prim overheard part of a conversation
which leaves no doubt that you are officers in Mejia&rsquo;s army.
Besides, you were seen coming from the quarter where he encamped
this morning. Is this so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen and I exchanged glances. My worst fears were
confirmed&mdash;we had been betrayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this so? I repeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you, an English officer who has fought for
Spain, actually sunk so low as to serve with a herd of ruffianly
rebels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, General Griscelli, I never deserted to the
enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taunt stung him to the quick. Livid with rage he sprung from
his chair and placed his hand on his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that you are in my power?&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;Had you uttered this insult in Spanish instead of
in French, I would have strung you up without more ado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insulted me first. If you are a true caballero give
me the satisfaction which I have a right to demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or; I don&rsquo;t meet rebels on the field
of honor. If they are common folk I hang them; if they are
gentlemen I behead them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is in store for us, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Por Dios!</em> you take it very coolly. Perhaps
neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will let me go, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you go! Let you go! Yes, I <em>will</em> let you
go,&rdquo; laughing like a man who has made a telling joke, or
conceived a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be impatient, se&ntilde;or; I should like to
have the pleasure of your company for a day or two before we part.
Perhaps after&mdash;What is the strength of Mejia&rsquo;s
army?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decline to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could make you say, though, if it were worth
the trouble. As it happens, I know already. He has about two
thousand infantry and one thousand cavalry. What has he come here
for? Does the fool actually suppose that with a force like that he
can capture San Felipe? Such presumption deserves punishment, and I
shall give him a lesson he will not easily forget&mdash;if he lives
to remember it. Your name and quality, se&ntilde;or&rdquo; (to
Carmen).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salvador Carmen, <em>teniente</em> in the patriot
army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have heard how I treat patriots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, general, and I should like to treat you in the same
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you would like to hang me. In that case you
cannot complain if I hang you. However I won&rsquo;t hang
you&mdash;to-day. I will either send you to the next world in the
company of your general, or let you go with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;with Se&ntilde;or Fortescue. That is all,
I think. Take him to the guard-house, sergeant&mdash;Stay! If you
will give me your parole not to leave the town without my
permission, or make any attempt to escape, you may remain at large,
Se&ntilde;or Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the escape in the circumstances seemed quite out of the
question, I gave my parole without hesitation, and asked the same
favor for my companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; (sternly). &ldquo;I could not believe a rebel
Creole on his oath. Take him away, sergeant, and see that he is
well guarded. If you let him escape I will hang you in his
stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite our bonds Carmen and I contrived to shake hands, or
rather, touch fingers, for it was little more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall meet again.&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;If I had
known that he would not take your parole I would not have given
mine. Let courage be our watchword. <em>Hasta
ma&ntilde;ana!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray take a seat, Se&ntilde;or Fortescue, and we will
have a talk about old times in Spain. Allow me to offer you a
cigar&mdash;I beg your pardon, I was forgetting that my fellows had
tied you up. Captain Guzman (to one of the loungers), will you
kindly loose Mr. Fortescue? <em>Gracias!</em> Now you can take a
cigar, and here is a chair for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was by no means sure that this sudden display of urbanity
boded me good, but being a prisoner, and at Griscelli&rsquo;s
mercy, I thought it as well to humor him, so accepted the cigar and
seated myself by his side.</p>
<p>After a talk about the late war in Spain, in the course of which
Griscelli told some wonderful stories of the feats he had performed
there (for the man was egregiously vain) he led the conversation to
the present war in South America, and tried to worm out of me where
I had been and what I had done since my arrival in the country. I
answered him courteously and diplomatically, taking good care to
tell him nothing that I did not want to be known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was a love of adventure
that brought you here&mdash;you English are always running after
adventures. A caballero like you can have no sympathy with these
rascally rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon; I do sympathize with the rebels; not,
I confess, as warmly as I did at first, and if I had known as much
as I know now, I think I should have hesitated to join
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They kill prisoners in cold blood, and conduct war more
like savages than Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, they do. Yes, killing prisoners in cold
blood is a brutal practice! I am obliged to be severe sometimes,
much to my regret. But there is only one way of dealing with a
rebellion&mdash;you must stamp it out; civil war is not as other
wars. Why not join us, Se&ntilde;or Fortescue? I will give you a
command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite out of the question, General Griscelli; I
am not a mere soldier of fortune. I have eaten these people&rsquo;s
salt, and though I don&rsquo;t like some of their ways, I wish well
to their cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think better of it, se&ntilde;or. The alternative might
not be agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever the alternative may be, my decision is
irrevocable. And you said just now you would let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I will let you go, since you insist on it&rdquo;
(smiling). &ldquo;All the same, I think you will regret your
decision&mdash;Mejia, of course, means to attack us. He can have
come with no other object&mdash;by your advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means he is acting against your advice. The man is
mad. He thought of taking us by surprise, I suppose. Why, I knew he
was on his way hither two days ago! And if he does not attack us
to-night&mdash;and we are quite ready for him&mdash;I shall capture
him and the whole of his army to-morrow. I want you to go with us
and witness the operation&mdash;in the character of a
spectator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you choose to put it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, there is no more to be said, though for
choice, I would rather not witness the discomfiture of my
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Griscelli gave an ironical smile, which I took to mean that it
was precisely for this reason that he asked me to accompany
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly receive Se&ntilde;or Fortescue, as your
guest, Captain Guzman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take him to your
quarters, give him his supper, and find him a bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Con mucho gusto.</em> Shall we go now, Se&ntilde;or
Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went, and spent a very pleasant evening with Captain Guzman,
and several of his brother-officers, whom he invited to join us,
for though the Spaniards of that age were frightfully cruel to
their enemies, they were courteous to their guests, and as a guest
I was treated. As, moreover, most of the men I met had served in
the Peninsular war, we had quite enough to talk about without
touching on topics whose discussion might have been incompatible
with good fellowship.</p>
<p>When, at a late hour, I turned into the hammock provided for me
by Guzman, it required an effort to realize that I was a prisoner.
Why, I asked myself, had Griscelli, who was never known to spare a
prisoner, whose face was both cruel and false, and who could bear
me no good-will&mdash;why had this man treated me so courteously?
Did he really mean to let me go, and if so, why; or was the promise
made to the ear merely to be broken to the hope?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps to-morrow will show,&rdquo; I thought, as I fell
asleep; and I was not far out, for the day after did. Guzman, whose
room I shared, wakened me long before daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bugle has sounded the reveille, and the troops are
mustering on the plaza,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You had better rise
and dress. The general has sent word that you are to go with us,
and our horses are in the <em>patio</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got up at once, and after drinking a hasty cup of coffee, we
mounted and joined Griscelli and his staff.</p>
<p>The troops were already under arms, and a few minutes later we
marched, our departure being so timed, as I heard the general
observe to one of his aides-de-camp, that we might reach the
neighborhood of the rebel camp shortly before sunrise. His plan was
well conceived, and, unless Mejia had been forewarned or was
keeping a sharper lookout than he was in the habit of doing, I
feared it would go ill with him.</p>
<p>The camping-ground was much better suited for concealment than
defence. It lay in a hollow in the hills, in shape like a
horse-shoe, with a single opening, looking east, and was commanded
in every direction by wooded heights. Griscelli&rsquo;s plan was to
occupy the heights with skirmishers, who, hidden behind the trees
and bushes, could shoot down the rebels with comparative security.
A force of infantry and cavalry would meanwhile take possession of
the opening and cut off their retreat. In this way, thought
Griscelli, the patriots would either be slaughtered to a man, or
compelled to surrender at discretion.</p>
<p>I could not deny (though I did not say so) that he had good
grounds for this opinion. The only hope for Mejia was that, alarmed
by our disappearance, he had stationed outposts on the heights and
a line of vedettes on the San Felipe road, and fortified the
entrance to the <em>quebrada</em>. In that case the attack might be
repulsed, despite the superiority of the Spanish infantry and the
disadvantages of Mejia&rsquo;s position. But the probabilities were
against his having taken any of these precautions; the last thing
he thought of was being attacked, and I could hardly doubt that he
would be fatally entangled in the toils which were being laid for
him.</p>
<p>While these thoughts were passing through my mind we were
marching rapidly and silently toward our destination, lighted only
by the stars. The force consisted of two brigades, the second of
which, commanded by General Estero, had gone on half an hour
previously. I was with the first and rode with Griscelli&rsquo;s
staff. So far there had not been the slightest hitch, and the
Spaniards promised themselves an easy victory.</p>
<p>It had been arranged that the first brigade should wait, about a
mile from the entrance to the valley until Estero opened fire, and
then advance and occupy the outlet. Therefore, when we reached the
point in question a halt was called, and we all listened eagerly
for the preconcerted signal.</p>
<p>And then occurred one of those accidents which so often mar the
best laid plans. After we had waited a full hour, and just as day
began to break, the rattle of musketry was heard on the heights,
whereupon Griscelli, keenly alive to the fact that every moment of
delay impaired his chances of success, ordered his men to fall in
and march at the double. But, unfortunately for the Spaniards, the
shots we had heard were fired too soon. The way through the woods
was long and difficult, Estero&rsquo;s men got out of hand; some of
them, in their excitement, fired too soon, with the result that,
when the first division appeared in the valley, the patriots,
rudely awakened from their fancied security, were getting under
arms, and Mejia saw at a glance into what a terrible predicament
his overconfidence had led him. He saw also (for though an
indifferent general he was no fool) that the only way of saving his
army from destruction, was to break out of the valley at all
hazards, before the Spaniards enclosed him in a ring of fire.</p>
<p>Mejia took his measures accordingly. Placing his
<em>llaneros</em> and <em>gauchos</em> in front and the infantry in
the rear, he advanced resolutely to the attack; and though it is
contrary to rule for light cavalry to charge infantry, this order,
considering the quality of the rebel foot, was probably the best
which he could adopt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Spanish position was very strong,
Griscelli massed his infantry in the throat of the
<em>quebrada</em>, the thickets on either side of it being occupied
in force. The reserve consisted exclusively of horse, an arm in
which he was by no means strong. Mejia was thus encompassed on
three sides, and had his foes reserved their fire and stood their
ground, he could not possibly have broken through them. But the
Spaniards opened fire as soon as the rebels came within range.
Before they could reload, the <em>gauchos</em> charged, and though
many saddles were emptied, the rebel horse rode so resolutely and
their long spears looked so formidable, that the Spaniards gave way
all along the line, and took refuge among the trees, thereby
leaving the patriots a free course.</p>
<p>This was the turning-point of the battle, and had the rebel
infantry shown as much courage as their cavalry the Spaniards would
have been utterly beaten; but their only idea was to get away; they
bolted as fast as their legs could carry them, an example which was
promptly imitated by the Spanish cavalry, who instead of charging
the rebel horse in flank as they emerged from the valley, galloped
off toward San Felipe, followed <em>nolens volens</em> by Griscelli
and his staff.</p>
<p>It was the only battle I ever saw or heard of in which both
sides ran away. If Mejia had gone to San Felipe he might have taken
it without striking a blow, but besides having lost many of his
brave <em>llaneros</em>, he had his unfortunate infantry to rally
and protect, and the idea probably never occurred to him.</p>
<p>As for the Spanish infantry, they stayed in the woods till the
coast was clear, and then hied them home.</p>
<p>Griscelli was wild with rage. To have his well-laid plans
thwarted by cowardice and stupidity, the easy victory he had
promised himself turned into an ignominious defeat at the very
moment when, had his orders been obeyed, the fortunes of the day
might have been retrieved&mdash;all this would have proved a severe
trial for a hero or a saint, and certainly Griscelli bore his
reverse neither with heroic fortitude nor saintly resignation. He
cursed like the jackdaw of Rheims, threatened dire vengeance on all
and sundry, and killed one of the runaway troopers with his own
hand. I narrowly escaped sharing the same fate. Happening to catch
sight of me when his passion was at the height he swore that he
would shoot at least one rebel, and drawing a pistol from his
holster pointed it at my head. I owed my life to Captain Guzman,
who was one of the best and bravest of his officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t do that, general,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It would be an ill requital for Se&ntilde;or
Fortescue&rsquo;s faithful observance of his parole. And you
promised to let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promised to let him go! So I did, and I will be as good
as my word,&rdquo; returned Griscelli, grimly, as he uncocked his
pistol. &ldquo;Yes, he shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. To-night. Meet me, both of you, near the old
sugar-mill on the savanna when the moon rises; and give him a good
supper, Guzman; he will need it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Azuferales.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is General Griscelli&rsquo;s game? Does he really
mean to let me go, or is he merely playing with me as a cat plays
with a mouse?&rdquo; I asked Guzman, as we sat at supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just the question I have been asking myself. I
never knew him let a prisoner go before, and I know of no reason
why he should treat you more leniently than he treats others. Do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He is more likely to bear me a grudge,&rdquo; and
then I told Guzman what had befallen at Salamanca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it still less probable that he will let you go
away quietly. Griscelli never forgives, and to-day&rsquo;s fiasco
has put him in a devil of a temper. He is malicious, too. We have
all to be careful not to offend him, even in trifles, or he would
make life very unpleasant for us, and I fear he has something very
unpleasant in store for you. You may depend upon it that he is
meditating some trick. He is quite capable of letting you go as far
as the bridge, and then bringing you back and hanging you or
fastening you to the tail of a wild mustang or the horns of a wild
bull. That also would be letting you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would, in a fashion! and I should prefer it to
being hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would. The hanging would be sooner
over and far less painful. And there are many other ways&mdash;he
might have your hands tied behind your back and cannon-balls
fastened to your feet, and then leave you to your own
devices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would not be so bad. We should find some good soul
to release us, and I think I could contrive to untie Carmen&rsquo;s
bonds with my teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or he might cut off your ears and put out your
eyes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake cease these horrible suggestions!
You make my blood run cold. But you cannot be serious. Is Griscelli
in the habit of putting out the eyes of his prisoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I am aware of; but I have heard him threaten to
do it, and known him to cut off a rebel&rsquo;s ears first and hang
him afterward. All the same I don&rsquo;t think he is likely to
treat you in that way. It might get to the ears of the
captain-general, and though he is not very particular where rebels
are concerned, he draws the line at mutilation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon see; we have to be at the old sugar-mill
when the moon rises,&rdquo; I said, gloomily, for the prospect held
out by Guzman was anything but encouraging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that will be soon. If I see any way of helping you,
without compromising myself, I will. Hospitality has its duties,
and I cannot forget that you have fought and bled for Spain. Have
another drink; you don&rsquo;t know what is before you? And take
this knife&mdash;it will serve also as a dagger&mdash;and this
pocket-pistol. Put them where they will not be seen. You may find
them useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gracias!</em> But you surely don&rsquo;t think we
shall be sent adrift weaponless and on foot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is as it may be; but it is well to provide for
contingencies. And now let us start; nothing irritates Griscelli so
much as having to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, girding on our swords (mine had been restored to me
&ldquo;by special favor,&rdquo; when I gave my parole), we mounted
our horses, which were waiting at the door, and set out.</p>
<p>The savanna was a wide stretch of open ground outside the
fortifications, where reviews were held and the troops performed
their evolutions; it lay on the north side of the town. Farther on
in the same direction was a range of low hills, thickly wooded and
ill provided with roads. The country to the east and west was
pretty much in the same condition. Southward it was more open, and
a score of miles away merged into the llanos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in good time; the moon is only just rising, and I
don&rsquo;t think there is anybody before us,&rdquo; said Guzman,
as we neared the old sugar-mill, a dilapidated wooden building,
shaded by cebia-trees and sombrero palms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is somebody behind us,&rdquo; I said, looking
back. &ldquo;A squadron of cavalry at the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Griscelli, I suppose, and Carmen. But why is the general
bringing so many people with him, I wonder? And don&rsquo;t I see
dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather! A pack of hounds, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right; they are Griscelli&rsquo;s blood-hounds.
Is it possible that a prisoner or a slave has escaped, and
Griscelli will ask us to join in the hunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Join in the hunt! You surely don&rsquo;t mean that you
hunt men in this country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes&mdash;when the men are slaves or rebels. It is
a sport the general greatly enjoys. Yet it seems very strange; at
this time of night, too&mdash;<em>Dios mio!</em> can it be
possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can what be possible, Captain Guzman?&rdquo; I exclaimed,
in some excitement, for a terrible suspicion had crossed my
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can what be possible? In Heaven&rsquo;s name speak
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, instead of answering, Guzman went forward to meet
Griscelli. I followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the general;
&ldquo;I am glad you are so punctual. I have brought your friend,
Se&ntilde;or Fortescue. As you were taken together, it seems only
right that you should be released together. It would be a pity to
separate such good friends. You see, I am as good as my word. You
don&rsquo;t speak. Are you not grateful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on the conditions, general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no conditions whatever. I let you go&mdash;neither
more nor less&mdash;whither you will. But I must warn you that,
twenty minutes after you are gone, I shall lay on my hounds. If you
outrun them, well and good; if not, <em>tant pis pour vous</em>. I
shall have kept my word. Are you not grateful, se&ntilde;or
Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; why should I be grateful for a death more terrible
than hanging. Kill us at once, and have done with it. You are a
disgrace to the noble profession of arms, general, and the time
will come&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another word, and I will throw you to the hounds without
further parley,&rdquo; broke in Griscelli, savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better keep quiet; there is nothing to be gained by
roiling him,&rdquo; whispered Carmen.</p>
<p>I took his advice and held my peace, all the more willingly as
there was something in Carmen&rsquo;s manner which implied that he
did not think our case quite so desperate as might appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismount and give up your weapons,&rdquo; said
Griscelli.</p>
<p>Resistance being out of the question, we obeyed with the best
grace we could; but I bitterly regretted having to part with the
historic Toledo and my horse Pizarro; he had carried me well, and
we thoroughly understood each other. The least I could do was to
give him his freedom, and, as I patted his neck by way of bidding
him farewell, I slipped the bit out of his mouth, and let him
go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! What is that&mdash;a horse loose? Catch him, some
of you,&rdquo; shouted Griscelli, who had been talking with his
huntsman and Captain Guzman, whereupon two of the troopers rode off
in pursuit, a proceeding which made Pizarro gallop all the faster,
and I knew that, follow him as long as they might, they would not
overtake him.</p>
<p>Griscelli resumed his conversation with Captain Guzman, an
opportunity by which I profited to glance at the hounds, and though
I was unable just then to regard them with very kindly feelings, I
could not help admiring them. Taller and more strongly built than
fox-hounds, muscular and broad-chested, with pendulous ears and
upper lips, and stern, thoughtful faces, they were splendid
specimens of the canine race; even sized too, well under control,
and in appearance no more ferocious than other hounds. Why should
they be? All hounds are blood-hounds in a sense, and it is probably
indifferent to them whether they pursue a fox, a deer, or a man; it
is entirely a matter of training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to let you have more law than I mentioned just
now&rdquo; said Griscelli, turning to Carmen and me. &ldquo;Captain
Guzman, here, and the huntsmen think twenty minutes would not give
us much of a run&mdash;these hounds are very fast&mdash;so I shall
make it forty. But you must first submit to a little operation.
Make them ready, Jose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon one of the attendants, producing a bottle, smeared our
shoes and legs with a liquid which looked like blood, and was, no
doubt, intended to insure a good scent and render our escape
impossible. While this was going on Carmen and I took off our coats
and threw them on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I give the word you may start,&rdquo; said
Griscelli, &ldquo;and forty minutes afterward the hounds will be
laid on&mdash;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way! Toward the hills!&rdquo; said Carmen.
&ldquo;Are you in good condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make all the haste we can, before the hounds are
laid on. If we can keep this up we shall reach the hills in forty
minutes&mdash;perhaps less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then? These hounds will follow us for ever&mdash;no
possibility of throwing them out&mdash;unless&mdash;is there a
river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None near enough, still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have hope, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little&mdash;I have an idea&mdash;if we can go on
running two hours&mdash;have you a flint and steel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a loaded pistol and a knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! That is better than I thought. But don&rsquo;t
talk. We shall want every bit of breath in our bodies before we
have done. This way! By the cane-piece there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With heads erect, arms well back, and our chests expanded to
their utmost capacity we sped silently onward; and although we do
not despair we realize to the full that we are running for our
lives; grim Death is on our track and only by God&rsquo;s help and
good fortune can we hope to escape.</p>
<p>Across the savanna, past corn-fields and cane-pieces we race
without pause&mdash;looking neither to the right nor
left&mdash;until we reach the road leading to the hills. Here we
stop a few seconds, take a few deep breaths, and then, on again. So
far, the road has been tolerable, almost level and free from
obstructions. But now it begins to rise, and is so rugged withal
that we have to slow our speed and pick our way. Farther on it is
the dry bed of a torrent, cumbered with loose stones and erratic
blocks, among which we have to struggle painfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is bad,&rdquo; gasps Carmen. &ldquo;The hounds must
be gaining on us fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the scent will be very catching among these
stones. They won&rsquo;t run fast here. Let us jump from block to
block instead of walking over the pebbles. It will make it all the
better for us and worse for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this suggestion we straightway act, but we find the striding
and jumping so exhausting, and the risk of slipping and breaking a
limb so great, that we are presently compelled to betake ourselves
once more to the bed of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; says Carmen, &ldquo;we shall soon be
out of this valley of stones, and the hounds will not find it easy
to pick up the scent hereabout. If we only keep out of their jaws
another half-hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we shall&mdash;and more&mdash;I hope for ever.
We can go on for another hour. But what is your point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>azuferales</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>azuferales</em>! What are the
<em>azuferales</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot explain now. You will see. If we get there ten
or fifteen minutes before the hounds we shall have a good chance of
escaping them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends&mdash;perhaps twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, lead on. It is life or
death? Even five minutes may make all the difference. Which
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this trail to the right, and through the
forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail is a broad grass-grown path, not unlike a
&ldquo;ride&rdquo; in an English wood, bordered by trees and thick
undergrowth, but fairly lighted by the moonbeams, and, fortunately
for us, rather downhill, with no obstacles more formidable than
fallen branches, and here and there a prostrate monarch of the
forest, which we easily surmount.</p>
<p>As we go on I notice that the character of the vegetation begins
to change. The trees are less leafy, the undergrowth is less dense,
and a mephitic odor pervades the air. Presently the foliage
disappears altogether, and the trees and bushes are as bare as if
they had been stricken with the blast of an Arctic winter; but
instead of being whitened with snow or silvered with frost they are
covered with an incrustation, which in the brilliant moonlight
makes them look like trees and bushes of gold. Over their tops rise
faint wreaths of yellowish clouds and the mephitic odor becomes
more pronounced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; shouts Carmen, as we reach the end of the
trail. &ldquo;At last! <em>Amigo mio</em>, we are saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before us stretches a wide treeless waste like a turf moor, with
a background of sombre forest. The moor, which is broken into humps
and hillocks, smokes and boils and babbles like the hell-broth of
Macbeth&rsquo;s witches, and across it winds, snake-wise, a
steaming brook. Here and there is a stagnant pool, and underneath
can be heard a dull roar, as if an imprisoned ocean were beating on
a pebble-strewed shore. There is an unmistakable smell of sulphur,
and the ground on which we stand, as well as the moor itself, is of
a deep-yellow cast.</p>
<p>This, then, is the <em>azuferales</em>&mdash;a region of sulphur
springs, a brimstone inferno, a volcano in the making. No hounds
will follow us over that hideous heath and through that Stygian
stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get across and live?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Will it
bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. But out with your knife and cut some twigs;
and where are your flint and steel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set the forest on fire&mdash;the wind is from
us&mdash;and instead of following us farther&mdash;and who knows
that they won&rsquo;t try?&mdash;instead of following us farther
they will have to hark back and run for their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word we set to work gathering twigs, which we
place among the trees. Then I dig up with my knife and add to the
heap several pieces of the brimstone impregnated turf. This done, I
strike a light with my flint and steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaims Carmen. &ldquo;In five minutes it
will be ablaze; in ten, a brisk fire;&rdquo; and with that we throw
on more turf and several heavy branches which, for the moment,
almost smother it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, it still burns, and&mdash;hark! What is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The baying of the hounds and the cries of the hunters.
They are nearer than I thought. To the <em>azuferales</em> for our
lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moor, albeit in some places yielding and in others
treacherous, did not, as I feared, prove impassable. By threading
our way between the smoking sulphur heaps and carefully avoiding
the boiling springs we found it possible to get on, yet slowly and
with great difficulty; and it soon became evident that, long before
we gain the forest the hounds will be on the moor. Their
deep-throated baying and the shouts of the field grow every moment
louder and more distinct. If we are viewed we shall be lost; for if
the blood-hounds catch sight of us not even the terrors of the
<em>azuferales</em> will balk them of their prey. And to our dismay
the fire does not seem to be taking hold. We can see nothing of it
but a few faint sparks gleaming through the bushes.</p>
<p>But where can we hide? The moor is flat and treeless, the forest
two or three miles away in a straight line, and we can go neither
straight nor fast. If we cower behind one of the smoking brimstone
mounds we shall be stifled; if we jump into one of the boiling
springs we shall be scalded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can we hide?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can we hide?&rdquo; repeated Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That pool! Don&rsquo;t you see that, a little farther on,
the brook forms a pool, and, though it smokes, I don&rsquo;t think
it is very hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just the place,&rdquo; and with that Carmen runs
forward and plunges in.</p>
<p>I follow him, first taking the precaution to lay my pistol and
knife on the edge. The water, though warm, is not uncomfortably
hot, and when we sit down our heads are just out of the water.</p>
<p>We are only just in time. Two minutes later the hounds, with a
great crash, burst out of the forest, followed at a short interval
by half a dozen horsemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse this brimstone! It has ruined the scent,&rdquo; I
heard Griscelli say, as the hounds threw up their heads and came to
a dead stop. &ldquo;If I had thought those <em>ladrones</em> would
run hither I would not have given them twenty minutes, much less
forty. But they cannot be far off; depend upon it, they are hiding
somewhere.&mdash;<em>Por Dios</em>, Sheba has it! Good dog! Hark to
Sheba! Forward, forward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. One of the hounds had hit off the line, then
followed another and another, and soon the entire pack was once
more in full cry. But the scent was very bad, and seemed to grow
worse; there was a check every few yards, and when they got to the
brook (which had as many turns and twists as a coiled rope), they
were completely at fault. Nevertheless, they persevered, questing
about all over the moor, except in the neighborhood of the sulphur
mounds and the springs.</p>
<p>While this was going on the horsemen had tethered their steeds
and were following on foot, riding over the <em>azuferales</em>
being manifestly out of the question. Once Griscelli and Sheba, who
appeared to be queen of the pack, came so near the pool that if we
had not promptly lowered our heads to the level of the water they
would certainly have seen us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid they have given us the slip,&rdquo; I heard
Griscelli say. &ldquo;There is not a particle of scent. But if they
have not fallen into one of those springs and got boiled,
I&rsquo;ll have them yet&mdash;even though I stop all night, or
come again to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mira! Mira!</em> General, the forest is on
fire!&rdquo; shouted somebody. &ldquo;And the horses&mdash;see,
they are trying to get loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed curses and cries of dismay, the huntsman sounded
his horn to call off the hounds and Carmen and I, raising our
heads, saw a sight that made us almost shout for joy.</p>
<p>The fire, which all this time must have been smouldering unseen,
had burst into a great blaze, trees and bushes were wrapped in
sulphurous flames, which, fanned by the breeze, were spreading
rapidly. The very turf was aglow; two of the horses had broken
loose and were careering madly about; the others were tugging
wildly at their lariats.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Griscelli and his companions, followed by the hounds,
were making desperate haste to get back to the trail and reach the
valley of stones. But the road was rough, and in attempting to take
short cuts several of them came to grief. Two fell into a deep pool
and had to be fished out. Griscelli put his foot into one of the
boiling springs, and, judging from the loud outcry he made, got
badly scalded.</p>
<p>By the time the hunters were clear of the moor the loose horses
had disappeared in the forest, and the trees on either side of the
trail were festooned with flames. Then there was mounting in hot
haste, and the riders, led by Griscelli (the two dismounted men
holding on to their stirrup leathers), and followed by the howling
and terrified hounds, tore off at the top of their speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are gone, and I don&rsquo;t think they will be in
any hurry to come back,&rdquo; said Carmen, as he scrambled out of
the pool. &ldquo;It was a narrow shave, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, and we are not out of the wood yet. Suppose the
fire sweeps round the moor and gains the forest on the other
side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case we stand a very good chance of being either
roasted or starved, for we have no food, and there is not a living
thing on the moor but ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A Timely Warning.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>The involuntary bath which saved our lives served also to
restore our strength. When we entered it we were well-nigh spent;
we went out of it free from any sense of fatigue, a result which
was probably as much due to the chemical properties of the water as
to its high temperature.</p>
<p>But though no longer tired we were both hungry and thirsty, and
our garments were wringing wet. Our first proceeding was to take
them off and wring them; our next, to look for fresh
water&mdash;for the <em>azuferales</em> was like the ocean-water,
water everywhere and not a drop to drink.</p>
<p>As we picked our way over the smoking waste by the light of the
full moon and the burning forest, I asked Carmen, who knew the
country and its ways so much better than myself, what he proposed
that we should do next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rejoin Mejia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how? We are in the enemies&rsquo; country and without
horses, and we know not where Mejia is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he is far off. He is not the man to
retreat after a drawn battle. Until he has beaten Griscelli or
Griscelli has beaten him, you may be sure he won&rsquo;t go back to
the llanos; his men would not let him. As for horses, we must
appropriate the first we come across, either by stratagem or
force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a way out of the forest on this side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is a good trail made by Indian invalids who
come here to drink the waters. Our difficulty will not be so much
in finding our friends as avoiding our enemies. A few hours&rsquo;
walk will bring us to more open country, but we cannot well start
until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! What is that?&rdquo; I exclaimed, as a
plaintive cry, which ended in a wail of anguish, such as might be
given by a lost soul in torment, rang through the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an <em>araguato</em>, a howling monkey,&rdquo;
said Carmen, indifferently. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only some old
fellow setting the tune; we shall have a regular chorus
presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we had. The first howl was followed by a second, then by
a third, and a fourth, and soon all the <em>araguatoes</em> in the
neighborhood joined in, and the din became so agonizing that I was
fain to put my fingers in my ears and wait for a lull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds dismal enough, in all conscience&mdash;to us;
but I think they mean it for a cry of joy, a sort of morning hymn;
at any rate, they don&rsquo;t generally begin until sunrise. But
these are perhaps mistaking the fire for the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And no wonder. It was spreading rapidly. The leafless trees that
bordered the western side of the <em>azuferales</em> were all
alight; sparks, carried by the wind, had kindled several giants of
the forest, which, &ldquo;tall as mast of some high admiral,&rdquo;
were flaunting their flaring banners a hundred feet above the mass
of the fire.</p>
<p>It was the most magnificent spectacle I had ever seen, so
magnificent that in watching it we forgot our own danger, as, if
the fire continued to spread, the forest would be impassable for
days, and we should be imprisoned on the <em>azuferales</em>
without either food or fresh water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; said Carmen, laying his hand on my
shoulder. A herd of deer were breaking out of the thicket and
bounding across the moor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild animals escaping from the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we shall have more of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely spoken when the deer were followed by a
drove of peccaries; then came jaguars, pumas, antelopes, and
monkeys; panthers and wolves and snakes, great and small, wriggling
over the ground with wondrous speed, and creatures the like of
which I had never seen before&mdash;a regular stampede of all sorts
and conditions of reptiles and beasts, and all too much frightened
to meddle either with us or each other.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, moreover, we were not in their line of
march, and there lay between us and them a line of hot springs and
smoking sulphur mounds which they were not likely to pass.</p>
<p>The procession had been going on about half an hour when,
happening to cast my eye skyward, I saw that the moon had
disappeared; overhead hung a heavy mass of cloud, the middle of it
reddened by the reflection from the fire to the color of blood,
while the outer edges were as black as ink. It was almost as grand
a spectacle as the burning forest itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to have rain,&rdquo; said Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it will rain in bucketfuls,&rdquo; was my answer,
for I had drunk nothing since we left San Felipe, and the run,
together with the high temperature and the heat of the fire, had
given me an intolerable thirst. I spoke with difficulty, my swollen
tongue clove to the roof of my mouth, and I would gladly have given
ten years of my life for one glass of cold water.</p>
<p>Carmen, whose sufferings were as great as my own, echoed my
hope. And it was not long in being gratified, for even as we gazed
upward a flash of lightning split the clouds asunder; peal of
thunder followed on peal, the rain came down not in drops nor
bucketfuls but in sheets, and with weight and force sufficient to
beat a child or a weakling to the earth, It was a veritable
godsend; we caught the beautiful cool water in our hands and drank
our fill.</p>
<p>In less than an hour not a trace of the fire could be
seen&mdash;nor anything else. The darkness had become so dense that
we feared to move lest we might perchance step into one of the
boiling springs, fall into the jaws of a jaguar, or set foot on a
poisonous snake. So we stayed where we were, whiles lying on the
flooded ground, whiles standing up or walking a few paces in the
rain, which continued to fall until the rising of the sun, when it
ceased as suddenly as it had begun.</p>
<p>The moor had been turned into a smoking swamp, with a blackened
forest on one side and a wall of living green on the other. The
wild animals had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go!&rdquo; said Carmen.</p>
<p>When we reached the trees we took off our clothes a second time,
hung them on a branch, and sat in the sun till they dried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is no use thinking about breakfast till we
get to a house or the camp, wherever that may be?&rdquo; I
observed, as we resumed our journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. What do you say about a cup of
milk to begin with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing I should like better&mdash;to begin
with&mdash;but where is the cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; pointing to a fine tree with oblong
leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the <em>palo de vaca</em> (cow-tree), and as
you shall presently see, it will give us a very good breakfast,
though we may get nothing else. But we shall want cups. Ah, there
is a calabash-tree! Lend me your knife a minute.
<em>Gracias!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that Carmen went to the tree, from which he cut a large
pear-shaped fruit. This, by slicing off the top and scooping out
the pulp he converted into a large bowl. The next thing was to make
a gash in the <em>palo de vaca</em>, whereupon there flowed from
the wound a thick milky fluid which we caught in the bowl and
drank. The taste was agreeable and the result satisfactory, for,
though a beefsteak would have been more acceptable, the drink
stayed our hunger for the time and helped us on our way.</p>
<p>The trail was easily found. For a considerable distance it ran
between a double row of magnificent mimosa-trees which met overhead
at a height of fully one hundred and fifty feet, making a glorious
canopy of green leaves and rustling branches. The rain had cooled
the air and laid the dust, and but for the danger we were in
(greater than we suspected) and the necessity we were under of
being continually on the alert, we should have had a most enjoyable
walk. Late in the afternoon we passed a hut and a maize-field, the
first sign of cultivation we had seen since leaving the
<em>azuferales</em>, and ascertained our bearings from an old peon
who was swinging in a grass hammock and smoking a cigar. San Felipe
was about two leagues away, and he strongly advised us not to
follow a certain trail, which he described, lest haply we might
fall in with Mejia&rsquo;s caballeros, some of whom he had himself
seen within the hour a little lower down the valley.</p>
<p>This was good news, and we went on in high spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so?&rdquo; said Carmen,
complacently. &ldquo;I knew Mejia would not be far off. He is like
one of your English bull-dogs. He never knows when he is
beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while the country became more open, with here and there
patches of cultivation; huts were more frequent and we met several
groups of peons who, however, eyed us so suspiciously that we
thought it inexpedient to ask them any questions.</p>
<p>About an hour before sunset we perceived in the near distance a
solitary horseman; but as his face was turned the other way he did
not see us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like one of our fellows,&rdquo; observed Carmen,
after scanning him closely. &ldquo;All the same, he may not be. Let
us slip behind this acacia-bush and watch his movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man himself seemed to be watching. After a short halt, he
rode away and returned, but whether halting or moving he was always
on the lookout, and as might appear, keenly expectant.</p>
<p>At length he came our way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe&mdash;<em>Por Dios</em> it is&mdash;Guido
Pasto, my own man!&rdquo; and Carmen, greatly excited, rushed from
his hiding-place shouting, &ldquo;Guido!&rdquo; at the top of his
voice.</p>
<p>I followed him, equally excited but less boisterous.</p>
<p>Guido, recognizing his master&rsquo;s voice, galloped forward
and greeted us warmly, for though he acted as Carmen&rsquo;s
servant he was a free <em>llanero</em>, and expected to be treated
as a gentleman and a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gracias a Dios!</em>&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I was
beginning to fear that we had passed you. Gahra and I have been
looking for you all day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very good of you; and Se&ntilde;or Fortescue and
I owe you a thousand thanks. But where are General Mejia and the
army?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near the old place. In a better position, though. But you
must not go there&mdash;neither of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not go there! But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if you do the general will hang you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang us! Hang Se&ntilde;or Fortescue, who has come all
the way from England to help us! Hang <em>me</em>, Salvador Carmen!
You have had a sunstroke and lost your wits; that&rsquo;s what it
is, Guido Pasto, you have lost your wits&mdash;but, perhaps you are
joking. Say, now, you are joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <em>se&ntilde;or</em>. It would ill become me to make
a foolish joke at your expense. Neither have I lost my wits, as you
are pleased to suggest. It is only too true; you are in deadly
peril. We may be observed, even now. Let us go behind these bushes,
where we may converse in safety. It was to warn you of your danger
that Gahra and I have been watching for you. Gahra will be here
presently, and he will tell you that what I say is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This passes comprehension. What does it all mean? Out
with it, good Guido; you have always been faithful, and I
don&rsquo;t think you are a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for your good opinion, se&ntilde;or. Well, it is
very painful for me to have to say it; but the general believes,
and save your own personal friends, all the army believes, that you
and se&ntilde;or Fortescue are traitors&mdash;that you betrayed
them to the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what grounds?&rdquo; asked Carmen, highly
indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went to reconnoitre; you did not come back; the next
morning we were attacked by Griscelli in force, and Se&ntilde;or
Fortescue was seen among the enemy, seen by General Mejia himself.
It was, moreover, reported this morning in the camp that Griscelli
had let you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he did, and hunted us with his infernal blood-hounds,
and we only escaped by the skin of our teeth. We were surprised and
taken prisoners. Se&ntilde;or Fortescue was a prisoner on parole
when the general saw him. I believe Griscelli obtained his parole
and took him to the <em>quebrada</em> for no other purpose than to
compromise him with the patriots. And that I, who have killed more
than a hundred Spaniards with my own hand, should be suspected of
deserting to the enemy is too monstrous for belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it is an absurd mistake. Appearances are
certainly rather against us&mdash;at any rate, against me; but a
word of explanation will put the matter right. Let us go to the
camp at once and have it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Se&ntilde;or Fortescue. I should like to
have it out much. But there is one little difficulty in the way
which you may not have taken into account. Mejia never listens to
explanations, and never goes back on his word. If he said he would
hang us he will. He would be very sorry afterward, I have no doubt;
but that would not bring us back to life, and it would be rather
ridiculous to escape Griscelli&rsquo;s blood-hounds, only to be
hanged by our own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is not the worst,&rdquo; put in Guido.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the worst! Why what can be worse than being
hanged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that even if the general did not carry out his
threat you would be killed all the same. The Colombian gauchos
swear that they will hack you to pieces wherever they find you.
When Gahra comes he will tell you the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard; what do you say?&rdquo; asked Carmen,
turning to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as it seems so certain that if we return to the
camp we shall either be hanged or hacked to pieces, I am decidedly
of opinion that we had better not return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. At the same time, it is quite evident that we
cannot remain here, while every man&rsquo;s hand is against us. Is
there any possibility of procuring horses, Guido?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I think Gahra and I will be able to bring you
horses and arms after nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! And will Gahra and you throw in your lot with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you go I will go, se&ntilde;or. Let Gahra speak for
himself. He will be here shortly. He is coming now. I will show
myself that he may know we are here&rdquo; (stepping out of the
thicket).</p>
<p>When the negro arrived he expressed great satisfaction at
finding us alive and well. He did not think there would be any
great difficulty in getting away and bringing us horses. The
<em>lleranos</em> were still allowed to come and go pretty much as
they liked, and if awkward questions were asked it would be easy to
invent excuses. The best time to get away would be immediately
after nightfall, when most of the foraging parties would have
returned to camp and the men be at supper.</p>
<p>It was thereupon agreed that the attempt should be made, and
that we should stay where we were until we heard the howl of an
<em>araguato</em>, which Guido could imitate to perfection. This
would signify that all was well, and the coast clear.</p>
<p>Then, after giving us a few pieces of <em>tasajo</em> and a
handful of cigars, the two men rode off; for the night was at hand,
and if we did not escape before light of moon, the chances were
very much against our escaping at all.</p>

<h2>A New Departure.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem always to be escaping, <em>amigo mio</em>,&rdquo;
said Carmen, as we sat in the shade, eating our <em>tasajo</em>.
&ldquo;We got out of one scrape only to get into another. Your
experience of the country so far has not been happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I certainly have had rather a lively time of it
since I landed at La Guayra, if that is what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very. And I should almost advise you to leave the
country, if that were possible. But reaching the coast in present
circumstances is out of the question. All the ports are in
possession of the Spaniards, and the roads thither beset by
guerillas. I see nothing for it but to go on the llanos and form a
guerilla band of our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t guerilla merely another name for
brigand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too often. You must promise the fellows
plunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And provide it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, or pay them out of your own pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not disposed to become a brigand chief; and I
could not keep a band of guerillas at my own charge even if I were
disposed. As we cannot get out of the country either by the north
or east, what do you say to trying south?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far? To the Brazils?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farther. Over the Andes to Peru.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the Andes to Peru? That is a big undertaking. Do you
think we could find that mountain of gold and precious stones you
were telling me about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never entertained any idea so absurd. I merely
mentioned poor old Zamorra&rsquo;s crank as an instance of how
credulous people could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps the idea is not quite so absurd as you
suppose. Even stranger things have happened; and we do know that
there is gold pretty nearly everywhere on this continent, to say
nothing of the treasure hidden in times past by Indians and
Spaniards, and we might find both gold and diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we might; and as we cannot stay here, we may as
well make the attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not forgetting that it will be very dangerous? We
shall carry our lives in our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be nothing new; I have carried my life in my
hands ever since I came to Venezuela.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, and if you are prepared to encounter the risk and
the hardship&mdash;As for myself, I must confess that the idea
pleases me. But have you any money? We shall have to equip our
expedition. If there are only four of us we shall not get beyond
the Rio Negro. The Indians of that region are as fierce as
alligators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a few <em>maracotes</em> in the waistband of my
trousers and this ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ring is worth nothing, my friend; at any rate not
more than a few reals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few reals! It contains a ruby, though you don&rsquo;t
see it, worth fully five hundred piasters&mdash;if I could find a
customer for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will easily find a customer for a
ruby ring on the llanos. However, I&rsquo;ll tell you what. An old
friend of mine, a certain Se&ntilde;or Morillones, has a large
estate at a place called Naparima on the Apure. Let us go there to
begin with. Morillones will supply us with mules, and we may
possibly persuade some of his people to accompany us.
Treasure-hunting is always an attraction for the adventurous. What
say you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. By all means let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may regard it as settled, then, that we make in the
first instance for Naparima.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That being the case the best thing we can do is to have a
sleep. We got none last night, and we are not likely to get any
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Carmen spoke he folded his arms and shut his eyes. I followed
his example, and we knew no more until, as it seemed in about five
minutes, we were roused by a terrific howl.</p>
<p>We jumped up at once and ran out of the thicket. Gahra and Guido
were waiting for us, each with a led horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were beginning to think you had been taken, or gone
away,&rdquo; said Guido, hoarsely. &ldquo;I have howled six times
in succession. My voice will be quite ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did not sound so just now. We were fast
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pizarro!&rdquo; I exclaimed, greatly delighted by the
sight of my old favorite. &ldquo;You have brought Pizarro! How did
you manage that, Gahra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to the camp last night. But mount at once,
se&ntilde;or. We got away without difficulty&mdash;stole off while
the men were at supper. But we met an officer who asked us a
question; and though Guido said we were taking the horses by order
of General Mejia himself, he did not appear at all satisfied, and
if he should speak to the general something might happen,
especially as it is not long since we left the camp, and we have
been waiting here ten minutes. Here is a spear for you, and the
pistols in your holsters are loaded and primed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mounted without asking any more questions. Gahra&rsquo;s news
was disquieting, and we had no time to lose; for, in order to reach
the llanos without the almost certainty of falling into the hands
of our friend Griscelli, we should have to pass within a mile of
the patriot camp, and if an alarm were given, our retreat might be
cut off. This, however, seemed to be our only danger; our horses
were fleet and fresh, and the llanos near, and, once fairly away,
we might bid defiance to pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us push on,&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;If anybody
accosts us don&rsquo;t answer a word, and fight only at the last
extremity, to save ourselves from capture or death; and, above all
things, silence in the ranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was clear, the sky studded with stars, and, except
where trees overhung the road, we could see some little distance
ahead, the only direction in which we had reason to apprehend
danger.</p>
<p>Carmen and I rode in front; Gahra and Guido a few yards in the
rear.</p>
<p>We had not been under way more than a few minutes when Gahra
uttered an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist, se&ntilde;ores! Look behind!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Turning half round in our saddles and peering intently into the
gloom we could just make out what seemed like a body of horsemen
riding swiftly after us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a belated foraging party returning to
camp,&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;Deucedly awkward, though! But they
have, perhaps, no desire to overtake us. Let us go on just fast
enough to keep them at a respectful distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it very soon became evident that the foraging party&mdash;if
it were a foraging party&mdash;did desire to overtake us. They put
on more speed; so did we. Then came loud shouts of
&ldquo;<em>Halte!</em>&rdquo; These producing no effect, several
pistol shots were fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Dios mio!</em>&rdquo; said Carmen; &ldquo;they will
rouse the camp, and the road will be barred. Look here, Fortescue;
about two miles farther on is an open glade which we have to cross,
and which the fellows must also cross if they either meet or
intercept us. The trail to the left leads to the llanos. It runs
between high banks, and is so narrow that one resolute man may stop
a dozen. If any of the <em>gauchos</em> get there before us we are
lost. Your horse is the fleetest. Ride as for your life and hold it
till we come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the words were well out of Carmen&rsquo;s mouth, I let
Pizarro go. He went like the wind. In six minutes I had reached my
point and taken post in the throat of the pass, well in the shade.
And I was none too soon, for, almost at the same instant, three
<em>llaneros</em> dashed into the clearing, and then, as if
uncertain what to do next, pulled up short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereabout was it? What trail shall we take?&rdquo; asked
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&rdquo; (pointing to the road I had just
quitted).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear the shouts?&mdash;and there goes
another pistol shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better divide,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;I will stay
here and watch. You, Jos&eacute;, go forward, and you, Sanchez,
reconnoitre the llanos trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; went his way, Sanchez came my way.</p>
<p>Still in the shade and hidden, I drew one of my pistols and
cocked it, fully intending, however, to reserve my fire till the
last moment; I was loath to shoot a man with whom I had served only
a few days before. But when he drew near, and, shouting my name,
lowered his lance, I had no alternative; I fired, and as he fell
from his horse, the others galloped into the glade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward! To the llanos!&rdquo; cried Carmen; &ldquo;they
are close behind us. A fellow tried to stop me, but I rode him
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then followed a neck-or-nothing race through the pass, which
was more like a furrow than a road, steep, stony, and full of
holes, and being overshadowed by trees, as dark as chaos. Only by
the marvellous cleverness of our unshod horses and almost
miraculous good luck did we escape dire disaster, if not utter
destruction, for a single stumble might have been fatal.</p>
<p>But Carmen, who made the running, knew what he was about. His
seeming rashness was the truest prudence. Our pursuers would either
ride as hard as we did or they would not; in the latter event we
should have a good start and be beyond their ken before they
emerged from the pass; in the former, there was always the off
chance of one of the leading horsemen coming to grief and some of
the others falling over him, thereby delaying them past the
possibility of overtaking us.</p>
<p>Which of the contingencies came to pass, or whether the
guerillas, not having the fear of death behind them, rode less
recklessly than we did, we could form no idea. But their shouts
gradually became fainter; when we reached the llanos they were no
more to be heard, and when the moon rose an hour later none of our
pursuers were to be seen. Nevertheless, we pushed on, and except
once, to let our animals drink and (relieved for a moment of their
saddles) refresh themselves with a roll, after the want of
Venezuelan horses, we drew not rein until we had put fifty miles
between ourselves and Generals Mejia and Griscelli.</p>

<h2>Don Esteban&rsquo;s Daughter.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Ten days after our flight from San Felipe we were on the banks
of the Apure. We received a warm welcome from Carmen&rsquo;s
friend, Se&ntilde;or Morillones, a Spanish creole of the antique
type, grave, courtly, and dignified, the owner of many square miles
of fertile land and hundreds of slaves, and as rich in flocks and
herds as Job in the heyday of his prosperity. He had a large house,
fine gardens, and troops of servants. A grand seigneur in every
sense of the word was Se&ntilde;or Don Esteban Morillones. His
assurance that he placed himself and his house and all that was his
at our disposal was no mere phrase. When he heard of our
contemplated journey, he offered us mules, arms, and whatever else
we required and he possessed, and any mention of payment on our
part would, as Carmen said, and I could well see, have given our
generous host dire offense.</p>
<p>We found, moreover, that we could easily engage as many men as
we wanted, on condition of letting them be our co-adventurers and
share in the finds which they were sure we should make; for nobody
believed that we would undertake so long and arduous a journey with
any other purpose than the seeking of treasure. Our business being
thus satisfactorily arranged, we might have started at once, but,
for some reason or other&mdash;probably because he found our
quarters so pleasant&mdash;Carmen held back. Whenever I pressed the
point he would say: &ldquo;Why so much haste, my dear fellow? Let
us stay here awhile longer,&rdquo; and it was not until I
threatened to go without him that he consented to &ldquo;name the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Don Esteban had a daughter, by name Juanita, a beautiful
girl of seventeen, as fresh as a rose, and as graceful as a
gazelle, a girl with whom any man might be excused for falling in
love, and she showed me so much favor, and, as it seemed, took so
much pleasure in my company, that only considerations of prudence
and a sense of what was due to my host, and the laws of
hospitality, prevented me from yielding myself a willing captive to
her charms. But as the time fixed for our departure drew near, this
policy of renunciation grew increasingly difficult. Juanita was too
unsophisticated to hide her feelings, and I judged from her ways
that, without in the least intending it, I had won her heart. She
became silent and preoccupied. When I spoke of our expedition the
tears would spring to her eyes, and she would question me about its
dangers, say how greatly she feared we might never meet again, and
how lonely she should feel when we were gone.</p>
<p>All this, however flattering to my <em>amour propre</em>, was
both embarrassing and distressing, and I began seriously to doubt
whether it was not my duty, the laws of hospitality to the contrary
notwithstanding, to take pity on Juanita, and avow the affection
which was first ripening into love. She would be my advocate with
Don Esteban, and seeing how much he had his daughter&rsquo;s
happiness at heart, there could be little question that he would
pardon my presumption and sanction our betrothal.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the preparations for our expedition went on, and
the time for our departure was drawing near, when one evening, as I
returned from a ride, I found Juanita alone on the veranda, gazing
at the stars, and looking more than usually pensive and
depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are still resolved to go, Se&ntilde;or
Fortescue?&rdquo; she said, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must. One of my principal reasons for coming to South
America is to make an expedition to the Andes, and I want much to
travel in parts hitherto unexplored. And who knows? We may make
great discoveries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you might stay with us a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear we have trespassed too long on your hospitality
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our hospitality is not so easily exhausted. But, O
se&ntilde;or, you have already stayed too long for my
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too long, for your happiness, se&ntilde;orita! If I
thought&mdash;would you really like me to stay longer, to postpone
this expedition indefinitely, or abandon it altogether?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so much, se&ntilde;or, so much. The mere suggestion
makes me almost happy again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I make your wish my law, and say that it is
abandoned, how then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will make me happier than I can tell you, and your
debtor for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why would it make you so happy, dear Juanita?&rdquo;
I asked, tenderly, at the same time looking into her beautiful eyes
and taking her unresisting hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! Oh, don&rsquo;t you know? Have you not
guessed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have; all the same, I should like the avowal
from your own lips, dear Juanita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because if you stay, dear,&rdquo; she
murmured, lowering her eyes, and blushing deeply, &ldquo;if you
stay, dear Salvador will stay too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Salvador! Dear Salvador! How&mdash;why&mdash;when?
I&mdash;I beg your pardon, se&ntilde;orita. I had no idea,&rdquo; I
stammered, utterly confounded by this surprising revelation of her
secret and my own stupidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you knew&mdash;that you had guessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean I had no idea that it had gone so far,&rdquo; I
said, recovering my self-possession with a great effort. &ldquo;So
you and Carmen are betrothed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We love. But if he goes on this dreadful expedition I am
sure my father would not consent, and Salvador says that as he has
promised to take part in it he cannot go back on his word. And I
said I would ask you to give it up&mdash;Salvador did not
like&mdash;he said it would be such a great disappointment; and I
am so glad you have consented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, se&ntilde;orita, I have not
consented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said only a minute ago that you would do as I
desired, and that my will should be your law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, se&ntilde;orita, I put it merely as a supposition, I
said if I did make your wish my law, how then? Less than ever can I
renounce this expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you were only mocking me! Cruel, cruel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than ever can I renounce this expedition. But I will
do what will perhaps please you as well. I will release Carmen from
his promise. He has found his fortune; let him stay. I have mine to
make; I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O se&ntilde;or, you have made me happy again. I thank you
with all my heart. We can now speak to my father. But you are
mistaken; it is not the same to me whether you go or stay so long
as you release Salvador from his promise. I would have you stay
with us, for I know that he and you are great friends, and that it
will pain you to part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will, indeed. He is a true man and one of the bravest
and most chivalrous I ever knew. I can never forget that he risked
his life to save mine. To lose so dear a friend will be a great
grief, even though my loss be your gain,
se&ntilde;orita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No loss, Se&ntilde;or Fortescue. Instead of one friend
you will have two. Your gain will be as great as mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My answer to these gracious words was to take her proffered hand
and press it to my lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Caramba!</em> What is this? Juanita? And you,
se&ntilde;or, is it the part of a friend? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be jealous, Salvador,&rdquo; said Juanita,
quietly to her lover, who had come on the balcony unperceived.
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Fortescue is a true friend. He is very good; he
releases you from your promise. And he seemed so sorry and spoke so
nobly that the least I could do was to let him kiss my
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did right, Juanita. I was hasty; I cry
<em>peccavi</em> and ask your forgiveness. And you really give up
this expedition for my sake, dear friend? Thanks, a thousand
thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I absolve you from your promise. But I shall go, all
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked very grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think better of it, <em>amigo mio</em>,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;When we formed this project we were both in a reckless mood.
Much of the country you propose to explore has never been trodden
by the white man&rsquo;s foot. It is a country of impenetrable
forests, fordless rivers, and unclimbable mountains. You will have
to undergo terrible hardships, you may die of hunger or of thirst,
and escape the poisoned arrows of wild Indians only to fall a
victim to the malarious fevers which none but natives of the
country can resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you learn all this? You talked very differently
a few days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, but I have been making inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have fallen in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, and that has opened my eyes to many
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the dangers of this expedition, for instance; likewise
to the fact that fighting Spaniards is not the only thing worth
living for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely; love is always stronger than hate, and I
confess that I hate the Spaniards much less than I did. Yet, in
this matter, I assure you that I do not in the least exaggerate.
You must remember that your companions will be half-breeds, men who
have neither the stamina nor the courage for really rough work.
When the hardships begin they are almost sure to desert you. If we
were going together we might possibly pull through, as we have
already pulled through so many dangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall miss you sorely. All the same, I am resolved
to go, even were the danger tenfold greater than you say it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feared as much. Well, if I cannot dissuade you from
attempting this enterprise, I must e&rsquo;en go with you, as I am
pledged to do. To let you undertake it alone, after agreeing to
bear you company were treason to our friendship. It would be like
deserting in the face of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, Carmen. The agreement has been cancelled by
mutual consent, and to leave Juanita after winning her heart would
be quite as bad as deserting in face of the enemy. And I have a
right to choose my company. You shall not go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juanita again gave me her hand, and from the look that
accompanied it I thought that, had I spoken first&mdash;but it was
too late; the die was cast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not go just yet,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;you
will stay with us a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you wish, se&ntilde;orita. A few days more or less
will make little difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several other attempts were made to turn me from my purpose. Don
Esteban himself (who was greatly pleased with his daughter&rsquo;s
betrothal to Carmen), prompted thereto by Juanita, entered the
lists. He expressed regret that he had not another daughter whom he
could bestow upon me, and went even so far as to offer me land and
to set me up as a Venezuelan country gentleman if I would consent
to stay.</p>
<p>But I remained firm to my resolve. For, albeit, none perceived
it but myself I was in a false position. Though I was hopelessly in
love with Juanita I liked her so well that the contemplation of
Carmen&rsquo;s happiness did not add to my own. I thought, too,
that Juanita guessed the true state of the case; and she was so
kind and gentle withal, and her gratitude at times was so
demonstrative that I feared if I stayed long at Naparima there
might be trouble, for like all men of Spanish blood, Carmen was
quite capable of being furiously jealous.</p>
<p>I left them a month before the day fixed for their marriage. My
companions were Gahra, and a dozen Indians and mestizoes, to each
of whom I was enabled, by Don Esteban&rsquo;s kindness, to give a
handsome gratuity beforehand.</p>
<p>To Juanita I gave as a wedding-present my ruby-ring, to Carmen
my horse Pizarro.</p>
<p>Our parting was one of the most painful incidents of my long and
checkered life. I loved them both and I think they loved me.
Juanita wept abundantly; we all embraced and tried to console
ourselves by promising each other that we should meet again; but
when or where or how, none of us could tell, and in our hearts we
knew that the chances against the fruition of our hopes were too
great to be reckoned.</p>
<p>Then, full of sad thoughts and gloomy forebodings, I set out on
my long journey to the unknown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XX" id="Ch_XX">Chapter XX.</a></h3>
<h2>The Happy Valley.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>My gloomy forebodings were only too fully realized. Never was a
more miserably monotonous journey. After riding for weeks, through
sodden, sunless forests and trackless wastes we had to abandon our
mules and take to our feet, spend weeks on nameless rivers, poling
and paddling our canoe in the terrible heat, and tormented almost
to madness by countless insects. Then the rains came on, and we
were weather-stayed for months in a wretched Indian village. But
for the help of friendly aborigines&mdash;and fortunately the few
we met, being spoken fair showed themselves friendly&mdash;we must
all have perished. They gave us food, lent us canoes, served us as
pilots and guides, and thought themselves well paid with a piece of
scarlet cloth or a handful of glass beads.</p>
<p>My men turned out quite as ill as I had been led to expect.
Several deserted at the outset, two or three died of fever, two
were eaten by alligators, and when we first caught sight of the
Andes, Gahra was my sole companion.</p>
<p>We were in a pitiful plight. I was weak from the effects of a
fever, Gahra lame from the effects of an accident. My money was
nearly all gone, my baggage had been lost by the upsetting of a
canoe, and our worldly goods consisted of two sorry mules, our
arms, the ragged clothes on our backs, and a few pieces of silver.
How we were to cross the Andes, and what we should do when we
reached Peru was by no means clear. As yet, the fortune which I had
set out to seek seemed further off than ever. We had found neither
gold nor silver nor precious stones, and all the coin I had in my
waist-belt would not cover the cost of a three days&rsquo; sojourn
at the most modest of <em>posaderos</em>.</p>
<p>But we have left behind us the sombre and rain-saturated forests
of the Amazon and the Orinoco, and the fine country around us and
the magnificent prospect before us made me, at least, forget for
the moment both our past privations and our present anxieties. We
are on the <em>monta&ntilde;a</em> of the eastern Cordillera, a
mountain land of amazing fertility, well wooded, yet not so thickly
as to render progress difficult; the wayside is bordered with
brilliant flowers, cascades tumble from rocky heights, and far away
to the west rise in the clear air the glorious Andes, alps on alps,
a vast range of stately snow-crowned peaks, endless and solemn,
veiled yet not hidden by fleecy clouds, and as cold and mysterious
as winter stars looking down on a sleeping world.</p>
<p>For a long time I gaze entranced at the wondrous scene, and
should probably have gone on gazing had not Gahra reminded me that
the day was well-nigh spent and that we were still, according to
the last information received, some distance from the mission of
San Andrea de Huanaco, otherwise Valle Hermoso, or Happy
Valley.</p>
<p>One of our chief difficulties had been to find our way; maps we
had none, for the very sufficient reason that maps of the region we
had traversed did not at that time exist; our guides had not always
proved either competent or trustworthy, and I had only the vaguest
idea as to where we were. Of two things only was I certain, that we
were south of the equator and within sight of the Andes of Peru
(which at that time included the countries now known as Ecuador and
Bolivia).</p>
<p>A few days previously I had fallen in with an old half-caste
priest, from whom I had heard of the Mission of San Andrea de
Huanaco, and how to get there, and who drew for my guidance a rough
sketch of the route. The priest in charge, a certain Fray Ignacio,
a born Catalan, would, he felt sure, be glad to find me quarters
and give me every information in his power.</p>
<p>And so it proved. Had I been his own familiar friend Fray
Ignacio could not have welcomed me more warmly or treated me more
kindly. A European with news but little above a year old was a
perfect godsend to him. When he heard that I had served in his
native land and the Bourbons once more ruled in France and Spain,
he went into ecstasies of delight, took me into his house, and gave
me of his best.</p>
<p>San Andrea was well named Valle Hermoso. It was like an alpine
village set in a tropical garden. The mud houses were overgrown
with greenery, the rocks mantled with flowers, the nearer heights
crested with noble trees, whose great white trunks, as smooth and
round as the marble pillars of an eastern palace, were roofed with
domes of purple leaves.</p>
<p>Through the valley and between verdant banks and blooming
orchards meandered a silvery brook, either an affluent or a source
of one of the mighty streams which find their homes in the great
Atlantic.</p>
<p>The mission was a village of tame Indians, whose ancestors had
been &ldquo;Christianized,&rdquo; by Fray Ignacio&rsquo;s Jesuit
predecessor. But the Jesuits had been expelled from South America
nearly half a century before. My host belonged to the order of St.
Francis. The spiritual guide, as well as the earthly providence of
his flock, he managed their affairs in this world and prepared them
for the next. And they seemed nothing loath. A more listless,
easy-going community than the Indians of the Happy Valley it were
difficult to imagine. The men did little but smoke, sleep, and
gamble. All the real work was done by the women, and even they took
care not to over-exert themselves. All were short-lived. The women
began to age at twenty, the men were old at twenty-five and
generally died about thirty, of general decay, said the priest. In
my opinion of pure laziness. Exertion is a condition of healthy
existence; and the most active are generally the longest lived.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Fray Ignacio was content with his people. They
were docile and obedient, went regularly to church, had a great
capacity for listening patiently to long sermons, and if they died
young they got so much the sooner to heaven.</p>
<p>All the same, Fray Ignacio was not so free from care as might be
supposed. He had two anxieties. The Happy Valley was so far untrue
to its name as to be subject to earthquakes; but as none of a very
terrific character had occurred for a quarter of a century he was
beginning to hope that it would be spared any further visitations
for the remainder of his lifetime. A much more serious trouble were
the occasional visits of bands of wild Indians&mdash;<em>Indios
misterios</em>, he called them; what they called themselves he had
no idea. Neither had he any definite idea whence they came; from
the other side of the Cordilleras, some people thought. But they
neither pillaged nor murdered&mdash;except when they were resisted
or in drink, for which reason the father always kept his
<em>aguardiente</em> carefully hidden. Their worst propensity was a
passion for white girls. There were two or three <em>mestizo</em>
families in the village, some of whom were whiter, or rather, less
coppery than the others, and from these the <em>misterios</em>
would select and carry off the best-looking maidens; for what
purpose Fray Ignacio could not tell, but, as he feared, to
sacrifice to their gods.</p>
<p>When I heard that these troublesome visitors generally numbered
fewer than a score, I asked why, seeing that the valley contained
at least a hundred and fifty men capable of bearing arms, the
raiders were not resisted. On this the father smiled and answered,
that no earthly consideration would induce his tame Indians to
fight; it was so much easier to die. He could not even persuade the
<em>mestizoes</em> to migrate to a safer locality. It was easier to
be robbed of their children occasionally than to move their goods
and chattels and find another home.</p>
<p>I asked Fray Ignacio whether he thought these robbers of white
children were likely to pay him a visit soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid they are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is nearly
two years since their last visit, and they only come in summer.
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a curiosity to see these; and I think I could save
the children and give these wild fellows such a lesson that they
would trouble you no more&mdash;at any rate for a long time to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be inexpressibly grateful. But how,
se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon I disclosed my scheme. It was very simple; I proposed
to turn one of the most likely houses in the village into a small
fortress which might serve as a refuge for the children and which
Gahra and I would undertake to defend. We had two muskets and a
pair of double-barrelled pistols, and the priest possessed an old
blunderbuss, which I thought I could convert into a serviceable
weapon. In this way we should be able to shoot down four or five of
the <em>misterios</em> before any of them could get near us, and as
they had no firearms I felt sure that, after so warm a reception,
they would let us alone and go their way. The shooting would
demoralize them, and as we should not show ourselves they could not
know that the garrison consisted only of the negro and myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the priest, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought. &ldquo;I leave it to you. But remember that if you fail
they will kill you and everybody else in the place. However, I dare
say you will succeed, the firearms may frighten them, and, on the
whole, I think the risk is worth running!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next question was how to get timely warning of the
enemy&rsquo;s approach. I suggested posting scouts on the hills
which commanded the roads into the valley. I thought that, albeit
the tame Indians were good for nothing else, they could at least
sit under a tree and keep their eyes open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would fall asleep,&rdquo; said Fray Ignacio.</p>
<p>So we decided to keep a lookout among ourselves, and ask the
girls who tended the cattle to do the same. They were much more
wide-awake than the men, if the latter could be said to be awake at
all.</p>
<p>The next thing was to fortify the priest&rsquo;s house, which
seemed the most suitable for our purpose. I strengthened the wall
with stays, repaired the old <em>trabuco</em>, which was almost as
big as a small cannon, and made ready for barricading the doors and
windows on the first alarm.</p>
<p>This done, there was nothing for it but to wait with what
patience I might, and kill time as I best could. I walked about,
fished in the river, and talked with Fray Ignacio. I would have
gone out shooting, for there was plenty of game in the
neighborhood, only that I had to reserve my ammunition for more
serious work.</p>
<p>For the present, at least, my idea of exploring the Andes
appeared to be quite out of the question. I should require both
mules and guides, and I had no money either to buy the one or to
pay the other.</p>
<p>And so the days went monotonously on until it seemed as if I
should have to remain in this valley surnamed Happy for the term of
my natural life, and I grew so weary withal that I should have
regarded a big earthquake as a positive god-send. I was in this
mood, and ready for any enterprise, however desperate, when one
morning a young woman who had been driving cattle to an upland
pasture, came running to Fray Ignacio to say that she had seen a
troop of horsemen coming down from the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>misterios</em>!&rdquo; said the priest, turning
pale. &ldquo;Are you still resolved, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I answered, trying to look grave,
though really greatly delighted. &ldquo;Be good enough to send for
the girls who are most in danger. Gahra and I will take possession
of the house, and do all that is needful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was further arranged that Fray Ignacio should remain outside
with his tame Indians, and tell the <em>misterios</em> that all the
good-looking <em>mestiza</em>, maidens were in his house, guarded
by braves from over the seas, who would strike dead with lightning
anybody who attempted to lay hands on them.</p>
<p>By the time our preparations were completed, and the frightened
and weeping girls shut up in an inner room, the wild Indians were
at the upper end of the big, straggling village, and presently
entered a wide, open space between the ramshackle old church and
Ignacio&rsquo;s house. The party consisted of fifteen or sixteen
warriors mounted on small horses. All rode bare-back, were naked to
the waist, and armed with bows and arrows and the longest spears I
had yet seen.</p>
<p>The tame Indians looked stolidly on. Nothing short of an
earthquake would have disturbed their self-possession. Rather to my
surprise, for he had not so far shown a super-abundance of courage,
Fray Ignacio seemed equal to the occasion. He was tall, portly, and
white-haired, and as he stood at the church door, clad in his
priestly robes, he looked venerable and dignified.</p>
<p>One of the <em>misterios</em>, whom from his remarkable
head-dress&mdash;a helmet made of a condor&rsquo;s skull&mdash;I
took to be a cacique, after greeting the priest, entered into
conversation with him, the purport of which I had no difficulty in
guessing, for the Indian, laughing loudly, turned to his companions
and said something that appeared greatly to amuse them. Neither he
nor they believed Fray Ignacio&rsquo;s story of the great pale-face
chief and his death-dealing powers.</p>
<p>The cacique, followed by a few of his men, then rode leisurely
toward the house. He was a fine-looking fellow, with cigar-colored
skin and features unmistakably more Spanish than Indian.</p>
<p>My original idea was to shoot the first two of them, and so
strike terror into the rest. But the cacique bore himself so
bravely that I felt reluctant to kill him in cold blood; and,
thinking that killing his horse might do as well, I waited until
they were well within range, and, taking careful aim, shot it
through the head. As the horse went down, the cacique sprang nimbly
to his feet; he seemed neither surprised nor dismayed, took a long
look at the house, then waved his men back, and followed them
leisurely to the other side of the square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you, Gahra? Will they go away and leave us in
peace, or shall we have to shoot some of them?&rdquo; I said as I
reloaded my musket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we shall, se&ntilde;or. That tall man whose horse
you shot did not seem much frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything but that, and&mdash;what are they about
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild Indians, directed by their chief, were driving the tame
Indians together, pretty much as sheep-dogs drive sheep, and soon
had them penned into a compact mass in an angle formed by the
church and another building. Although the crowd numbered two or
three hundred, of whom a third were men, no resistance was offered.
A few of exceptionally energetic character made a languid attempt
to bolt, but were speedily brought back by the <em>misterios</em>,
whose long spears they treated with profound respect.</p>
<p>So soon as this operation was completed the cacique beckoned
peremptorily to the <em>padre</em>, and the two, talking earnestly
the while, came toward the house. It seemed as if the Indian chief
wanted a parley; but, not being quite sure of this, I thought it
advisable, when he was about fifty yards off, to show him the
muzzle of my piece. The hint was understood. He laid his weapons on
the ground, and, when he and the padre were within speaking
distance, the <em>padre</em>, who appeared very much disturbed,
said the cacique desired to have speech of me. Not to be outdone in
magnanimity I opened the door and stepped outside.</p>
<p>The cacique doffed his skull-helmet and made a low bow. I
returned the greeting, said I was delighted to make his
acquaintance, and asked what I could do to oblige him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up the maidens,&rdquo; he answered, in broken
Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot; they are in my charge. I have sworn to protect
them, and, as you discovered just now, I have the means of making
good my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true. You have lightning; I have none, and I shall
not sacrifice my braves in a vain attempt to take the maidens by
force. Nevertheless, you will give them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken. I shall not give them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great pale-face chief is a friend of these poor tame
people; he wishes them well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, and for that reason I shall not let you carry
off the seven maidens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many men and women and maidens are there yonder,
trembling before the spears of my braves like corn shaken by the
wind&mdash;fifty times seven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then my brother&mdash;for I also am a great
chief&mdash;my brother from over the seas holds the liberty of
seven to be of more account than the lives of fifty times
seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother speaks in riddles,&rdquo; I said,
acknowledging the cacique&rsquo;s compliment and adopting his
style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a riddle that a child might read. Unless the
maidens are given up&mdash;not to harm, but to be taken to our
country up there&mdash;unless they are given up the spears of my
braves will drink the blood of their kinsfolk, and my horses shall
trample their bodies in the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cacique spoke so gravely and his air was so resolute that I
felt sure he would do as he said, and I did not see how I could
prevent him. His men were beyond the range of our pieces, and to go
outside were to lose our lives to no purpose. We might get a couple
of shots at them, but, before we could reload, they would either
shoot us down with their bows or spit us with their spears.</p>
<p>Fray Ignacio, seeing the dilemma, drew me aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to do it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am very
sorry. The girls will either be sacrificed or brought up as
heathens; but better so than that these devils should be let loose
on my poor people, for, albeit some might escape, many would be
slaughtered. Why did you shoot the horse and let the savage and his
companion go scathless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well ask the question, father. I see what a
grievous mistake I made. When it came to the point, I did not like
to kill brave men in cold blood. I was too merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you say, a grievous mistake. Never repeat it,
se&ntilde;or. It is always a mistake to show mercy to <em>Indios
brutos</em>. But what will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose give up the girls; it is the smaller evil of
the two. And yet&mdash;I promised that no evil should befall
them&mdash;no, I must make another effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that I turned once more to the cacique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; I said, laying my hand on the pistol
in my belt&mdash;&ldquo;do you know that your life is in my
hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not flinch; but a look passed over his face which showed
that my implied threat had produced an effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true; but if a hair of my head be touched, all
these people will perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them perish! What are the lives of a few tame Indians
to me, compared with my oath? Did I not tell you that I had sworn
to protect the maidens&mdash;that no harm should befall them? And
unless you call your men off and promise to go quietly
away&mdash;&rdquo; Here I drew my pistol.</p>
<p>It was now the cacique&rsquo;s turn to hesitate. After a
moment&rsquo;s thought he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the lightning kill me, then. It were better for me to
die than to return to my people empty-handed; and my death will not
be unavenged. But if the pale-face chief will go with us instead of
the maidens, he will make Gondocori his friend, and these tame
Indians shall not die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go with you! But whither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gondocori pointed toward the Cordillera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To our home up yonder, in the heart of the
Andes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will you do with me when you get me
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fate will be decided by Mamcuna, our queen. If you
find favor in her sight, well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if not&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it would not be well&mdash;for you. But as she has
often expressed a wish to see a pale-face with a long beard, I
think it will be well; and in any case I answer for your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What security have I for this? How do I know that when I
am in your power you will carry out the compact?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard the word of Gondocori. See, I will swear
it on the emblem you most respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the cacique pressed his lips to the cross which hung from
Ignacio&rsquo;s neck. It was a strange act on the part of a wild
Indian, and confirmed the suspicion I already entertained, that
Condocori was the son of a Christian mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a heathen; his oath is worthless; don&rsquo;t trust
him, let the girls go,&rdquo; whispered the padre in my ear.</p>
<p>But I had already made up my mind. It was on my conscience to
keep faith with the girls; I wanted neither to kill the cacique nor
see his men kill the tame Indians, and whatever might befall me
&ldquo;up yonder&rdquo; I should at any rate get away from San
Andrea de Huanaco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The die is cast; I will go with you,&rdquo; I said,
turning to Gondocori.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I know, beyond a doubt, that my brother is the
bravest of the brave. He fears not the unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked if Gahra might bear me company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At his own risk. But I cannot answer for his safety.
Mamcuna loves not black people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not very encouraging, and after I had explained the
matter to Gahra I strongly advised him to stay where he was. But he
said he was my man, that he owed me his liberty, and would go with
me to the end, even though it should cost him his life.</p>

<h2>A Fight for Life.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>We have left behind us the <em>monta&ntilde;o</em>, with its
verdant uplands and waving forests, its blooming valleys,
flower-strewed savannas, and sunny waters, and are crawling
painfully along a ledge, hardly a yard wide, stern gray rocks all
round us, a foaming torrent only faintly visible in the prevailing
gloom a thousand feet below. Our mules, obtained at the last
village in the fertile region, move at the speed of snails, for the
path is slippery and insecure, and one false step would mean death
for both the rider and the ridden,</p>
<p>Presently the gorge widens into a glen, where forlorn flowers
struggle toward the scanty light and stunted trees find a
precarious foothold among the rocks and stones. Soon the ravine
narrows again, narrows until it becomes a mere cleft; the mule-path
goes up and down like some mighty snake, now mounting to a dizzy
height, anon descending to the bed of the thundering torrent. The
air is dull and sepulchral, an icy wind blows in our faces, and
though I am warmly clad, and wrapped besides in a thick
<em>poncho</em>, I shiver to the bone.</p>
<p>At length we emerge from this valley of the shadow of death, and
after crossing an arid yet not quite treeless plain, begin to climb
by many zigzags an almost precipitous height. The mules suffer
terribly, stopping every few minutes to take breath, and it is with
a feeling of intense relief that, after an ascent of two hours, we
find ourselves on the <em>cumbre</em>, or ridge of the
mountain.</p>
<p>For the first time since yesterday we have an unobstructed view.
I dismount and look round. Backward stretches an endless expanse of
bleak and stormy-swept billowy mountains; before us looms, in
serried phalanx, the western Cordillera, dazzling white, all save
one black-throated colossus, who vomits skyward thick clouds of
ashes and smoke, and down whose ragged flanks course streams of
fiery lava.</p>
<p>After watching this stupendous spectacle for a few minutes we go
on, and shortly reach another and still loftier <em>quebrada</em>.
Icicles hang from the rocks, the pools of the streams are frozen;
we have reached an altitude as high as the summit of Mont Blanc,
and our distended lips, swollen hands, and throbbing temples show
how great is the rarefaction of the air.</p>
<p>None of us suffer so much from the cold as poor Gahra. His ebon
skin has turned ashen gray, he shivers continually, can hardly
speak, and sits on his mule with difficulty.</p>
<p>The country we are in is uninhabited and the trail we are
following known only to a few Indians. I am the first white man,
says Gondocori, by whom it has been trodden.</p>
<p>We pass the night in a ruined building of cyclopean dimensions,
erected no doubt in the time of the Incas, either for the
accommodation of travellers by whom the road was then frequented or
for purposes of defence. But being both roofless, windowless, and
fireless, it makes only a poor lodging. The icy wind blows through
a hundred crevices; my limbs are frozen stiff, and when morning
comes many of us look more dead than alive.</p>
<p>I asked Condocori how the poor girls of San Andrea could
possibly have survived so severe a journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weaker would have died. But I did not expect this
cold. The winter is beginning unusually early this year. Had we
been a few days later we should not have got through at all, and if
it begins to snow it may go ill with us, even yet. But to-morrow
the worst will be over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cacique had so far behaved very well, treating me as a
friend and an equal, and doing all he could for my comfort. His men
treated me as a superior. Gondocori said very little about his
country, still less about Queen Mamcuna, whom he also called
&ldquo;Great Mother.&rdquo; To my frequent questions on these
subjects he made always the same answer: &ldquo;Patience, you will
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did, however, tell me that his people called their country
Pachatupec and themselves Pachatupecs, that the Spaniards had never
subdued them or even penetrated into the fastnesses where they
dwelt, and that they spoke the ancient language of Peru.</p>
<p>Gondocori admitted that his mother was a Christian, and to her
he no doubt owed his notions of religion and the regularity of his
features. She had been carried off as he meant to carry off the
seven maidens of the Happy Valley, for the <em>misterios</em> had a
theory that a mixture of white and Indian blood made the finest
children and the boldest warriors. But white wives being difficult
to obtain, <em>mestiza</em> maidens had generally to be accepted,
or rather, taken in their stead.</p>
<p>We rose before daybreak and were in the saddle at dawn. The
ground and the streams are hard frozen, and the path is so slippery
that the trembling mules dare scarcely put one foot before the
other, and our progress is painfully slow. We are in a broad,
stone-strewed valley, partly covered with withered puma-grass, on
which a flock of graceful <em>vicu&ntilde;as</em> are quietly
grazing, as seemingly unconscious of our presence as the great
condors which soar above the snowy peaks that look down on the
plain.</p>
<p>As we leave the valley, through a pass no wider than a gateway,
the cacique gives me a word of warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The part we are coming to is the most dangerous of
all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it is, fortunately, not long. Two
hours will bring us to a sheltered valley. And now leave everything
to your mule. If you feel nervous shut your eyes, but as you value
your life neither tighten your reins nor try to guide
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I repeat this caution to Gahra, and ask how he feels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better, se&ntilde;or; the sunshine has given me new
life. I feel equal to anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now we have to travel once more in single file, for the path
runs along a mountain spur almost as perpendicular as a wall; we
are between two precipices, down which even the boldest cannot look
without a shudder. The incline, moreover, is rapid, and from time
to time we come to places where the ridge is so broken and insecure
that we have to dismount, let our mules go first, and creep after
them on our hands.</p>
<p>At the head of the file is an Indian who rides the
<em>madrina</em> (a mare) and acts as guide, next come Gondocori,
myself and Gahra, followed by the other mounted Indians, three or
four baggage-mules, and two men on foot.</p>
<p>We have been going thus nearly an hour, when a sudden and
portentous change sets in. Murky clouds gather round the higher
summits and shut out the sun, a thick mist settles down on the
ridge, and in a few minutes we are folded in a gloom hardly less
dense than midnight darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; shouts the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; I ask the cacique, whom, though
he is but two yards from me, I cannot see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. We can only wait here till the mist clears
away,&rdquo; he shouts in a muffled voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how soon may that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Quien Sabe?</em> Perhaps a few minutes, perhaps
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hours! To stand for hours, even for one hour, immovable in that
mist on that ridge would be death. Since the sun disappeared the
cold had become keener than ever. The blood seems to be freezing in
my veins, my beard is a block of ice, icicles are forming on my
eyelids.</p>
<p>If this goes on&mdash;a gleam of light! Thank Heaven, the mist
is lifting, just enough to enable me to see Gondocori and the
guide. They are quite white. It is snowing, yet so softly as not to
be felt, and as the fog melts the flakes fall faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go on,&rdquo; says Gondocori. &ldquo;Better roll
down the precipice than be frozen to death. And if we stop here
much longer, and the snow continues, the pass beyond will be
blocked, and then we must die of hunger and cold, for there is no
going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we move on, slowly and noiselessly, amid the fast-falling
snow, like a company of ghosts, every man conscious that his life
depends on the sagacity and sure-footedness of his mule. And it is
wonderful how wary the creatures are. They literally feel their
way, never putting one foot forward until the other is firmly
planted. But the snow confuses them. More than once my mule slips
dangerously, and I am debating within myself whether I should not
be safer on foot, when I hear a cry in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I ask Gondocori, for I cannot see past
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guide is gone. The <em>madrina</em> slipped, and both
have rolled down the precipice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we get off and walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like. You will not be any safer, though you may
feel so. The mules are surer footed than we are, and they have four
legs to our two. I shall keep where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not caring to show myself less courageous than the
<em>cacique</em>, I also keep where I am. We get down the ridge
somehow without further mishaps, and after a while find ourselves
in a funnel-shaped gully the passage of which, in ordinary
circumstances, would probably present no difficulty. But just now
it is a veritable battle-field of the winds, which seem to blow
from every point of the compass at once. The snow dashes against
our faces like spray from the ocean, and whirls round us in blasts
so fierce that, at times, we can neither see nor hear. The mules,
terrified and exhausted, put down their heads and stand
stock-still. We dismount and try to drag them after us, but even
then they refuse to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they won&rsquo;t come they must die; and unless we
hurry on we shall die, too. Forward!&rdquo; cried Gondocori,
himself setting the example.</p>
<p>Never did I battle so hard for very life as in that gully. The
snow nearly blinded me, the wind took my breath away, forced me
backward, and beat me to the earth again and again. More than once
it seemed as if we should have to succumb, and then there would
come a momentary lull and we would make another rush and gain a
little more ground.</p>
<p>Amid all the hurly-burly, though I cannot think consecutively
(all the strength of my body and every faculty of my mind being
absorbed in the struggle), I have one fixed idea&mdash;not to lose
sight of Gondocori, and, except once or twice for a few seconds, I
never did. Where he goes I go, and when, after an unusually severe
buffeting, he plunges into a snow-drift at the end of the ravine, I
follow him without hesitation.</p>
<p>Side by side we fought our way through, dashing the snow aside
with our hands, pushing against it with our shoulders, beating it
down with our feet, and after a desperate struggle, which though it
appeared endless could have lasted only a few minutes, the victory
was ours; we were free.</p>
<p>I can hardly believe my eyes. The sun is visible, the sky clear
and blue, and below us stretches a grassy slope like a Swiss
&ldquo;alp.&rdquo; Save for the turmoil of wind behind us and our
dripping garments I could believe that I had just wakened from a
bad dream, so startling is the change. The explanation is, however,
sufficiently simple: the area of the <em>tourmente</em> is
circumscribed and we have got out of it, the gully merely a passage
between the two mighty ramparts of rock which mark the limits of
the tempest and now protect us from its fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to that moment I had not given them a thought. While the
struggle lasted thinking had not been possible. After we abandoned
the mules I had eyes only for Gondocori, and never once looked
behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo; I asked the
<em>cacique</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smothered in the snow; two minutes more and we also
should have been smothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go back and see. They may still live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! We could not get back if we had ten times the
strength and were ten instead of two. Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roar of the storm in the gully is louder than ever; the
drift, now higher than the tallest man, grows even as we look.</p>
<p>Fifteen men buried alive within a few yards of us, yet beyond
the possibility of help! Poor Gahra! If he had loved me less and
himself more, he would still be enjoying the <em>dolce far
niente</em> of Happy Valley, instead of lying there, stark and
stiff in his frozen winding-sheet. A word of encouragement, a
helping hand at the last moment, and he might have got through. I
feel as if I had deserted him in his need; my conscience reproaches
me bitterly. And yet&mdash;good God! What is that? A black hand in
the snow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a single bound I am there. Gondocori follows, and as
I seize one hand he finds and grasps the other, and we pull out of
the drift the negro&rsquo;s apparently lifeless body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; says the <em>cacique</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Raise him up, and let the sun
shine on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I take out my pocket-flask and pour a few drops of
<em>aguardiente</em> down his throat. Presently Gahra sighs and
opens his eyes, and a few minutes later is able to stand up and
walk about. He can tell very little of what passed in the gully. He
had followed Gondocori and myself, and was not far behind us. He
remembered plunging into the snow-drift and struggling on until he
fell on his face, and then all was a blank. None of the Indians
were with him in the drift; he felt sure they were all behind him,
which was likely enough, as Gahra, though sensitive to cold, was a
man of exceptional bodily strength. It was beyond a doubt that all
had perished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left Pachatupec with fifteen braves. I have lost my
braves, my mules, and my baggage, and all I have to show are two
men, a pale-face and a black-face. Not a single maiden. How will
Mamcuna take it, I wonder?&rdquo; said Gondocari, gloomily.
&ldquo;Let us go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think she will be very angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she very unpleasant when she is angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She generally makes it very unpleasant for others. Her
favorite punishment for offenders is roasting them before a slow
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you propose to go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can we do? Going back the way we came is out of
the question, equally so is climbing either of those
mountain-ranges. If we stay hereabout we shall starve. We have not
a morsel of food, and until we reach Pachatupec we shall get
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when may that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us go on, then; though, as between being
starved to death and roasted alive, there is not much to choose.
All the same, I should like to see this wonderful queen of whom you
are so much afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be afraid of her, too, and very likely will be
before you have done with her. Nevertheless, you may find favor in
her sight, and I have just bethought me of a scheme which, if you
consent to adopt it, may not only save our lives, but bring you
great honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that scheme, Gondocori?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will explain it later. This is no time for talk. We
must push on with all speed or we shall not get to the boats before
nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boats! You surely don&rsquo;t mean to say that we are to
travel to Pachatupec by boats. Boats cannot float on a frozen
mountain torrent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the cacique, who was already on the march, made no
answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XXII" id="Ch_XXII">Chapter XXII.</a></h3>
<h2>The Cacique&rsquo;s Scheme.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Shortly before sunset we arrived at our halting-place for the
night and point of departure for the morrow&mdash;a hollow in the
hills, hemmed in by high rocks, almost circular in shape and about
a quarter of a mile in diameter. The air was motionless and the
temperature mild, the ground covered with grass and shrubs and
flowers, over which hovered clouds of bright-winged butterflies.
Low down in the hollow was a still and silent pool, and though, so
far as I could make out, it had no exit, two large flat-bottomed
boats and a couple of canoes were made fast to the side. Hard by
was a hut of sun-dried bricks, in which were slung three or four
grass hammocks.</p>
<p>There was also fuel, so we were able to make a fire and have a
good warming, of which we stood greatly in need. But as nothing in
the shape of food could be found, either on the premises or in the
neighborhood, we had to go supperless to bed.</p>
<p>Before we turned in Gondocori let us into the secret of the
scheme which was to propitiate Queen Mamcuna, and bring us honor
and renown, instead of blame and (possibly) death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall tell her,&rdquo; said the cacique, &ldquo;that
though I have lost my braves and brought no maidens, I have brought
two famous medicine-men, who come from over the seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. But how are we to keep up the
character?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must profess your ability to heal the sick and read
the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing easier. But suppose we are put to the test? Are
there any sick in your country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few; Mamcuna herself is sick; you have only to cure her
and all will be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely; but how if I fail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she would make it unpleasant for all of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean she would roast us by a slow fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. There is no telling, though. Our Great Mother
is very ingenious in inventing new punishments, and to those who
deceive her she shows no mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. It is a case of kill or cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. If you don&rsquo;t cure her she will kill
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do my best, and as I have seen a good deal of
practical surgery, helped to dress wounds and set broken limbs, and
can let blood, you may truthfully say that I have some slight
knowledge of the healing art. But as for treating a sick
woman&mdash;However, I leave it to you, Gondocori. If you choose to
introduce me to her Majesty as a medicine-man I will act the part
to the best of my ability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask no more, se&ntilde;or; and if you are fortunate
enough to cure Mamcuna of her sickness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or make her believe that I have cured her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would do quite as well; you will thank me for
bringing you to Pachatupec, for although the queen can make things
very unpleasant for those who offend her, she can also make them
very pleasant for those whom she likes. And now, se&ntilde;ores, as
we must to-morrow travel a long way fasting, let us turn into our
hammocks and compose ourselves to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excellent advice, which I was only too glad to follow. But we
were awake long before daylight&mdash;for albeit fatigue often acts
as an anodyne, hunger is the enemy of repose&mdash;and at the first
streak of dawn wended to the silent pool.</p>
<p>As we stepped into the canoe selected by Gondocori (the boats
were intended for the transport of mules and horses) I found that
the water was warm, and, on tasting it, I perceived a strong
mineral flavor. The pool was a thermal spring, and its high
temperature fully accounted for the fertility of the hollow and the
mildness of the air. But how were we to get out of it? For look as
I might, I could see no signs either of an outlet or a current.
Gondocori, who acted as pilot, quickly solved the mystery. A
buttress of rock, which in the distance looked like a part of the
mass, screened the entrance to a narrow waterway. Down this
waterway the cacique navigated the canoe. It ran in tortuous course
between rocks so high that at times we could see nothing save a
strip of purple sky, studded with stars. Here and there the channel
widened out, and we caught a glimpse of the sun; and at an
immeasurable height above us towered the <em>nevados</em> (snowy
slopes) of the Cordillera.</p>
<p>The stream, if that can be called a stream which does not move,
had many branches, and we could well believe, as Gondocori told us,
that it was as easy to lose one&rsquo;s self in this watery
labyrinth as in a tropical forest. In all Pachatupec there were not
ten men besides himself who could pilot a boat through its
windings. He told us, also, that this was the only pass between the
eastern and western Cordillera in that part of the Andes, that the
journey from San Andrea to Pachatupec by any other route would be
an affair not of days but of weeks. The water was always warm and
never froze. Whence it came nobody could tell. Not from the melting
of the snow, for snow-water was cold, and this was always warm,
winter and summer. For his own part he thought its source was a
spring, heated by volcanic fires, and many others thought the same.
Its depth was unknown; he himself had tried to fathom it with the
longest line he could find, yet had never succeeded in touching
ground.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we were making good progress, sometimes paddling,
sometimes poling (where the channel was narrow) and toward evening
when, as I reckoned, we had travelled about sixty miles, we shot
suddenly into a charming little lake with sylvan banks and a sandy
beach.</p>
<p>Gondocori made fast the canoe to a tree, and we stepped
ashore.</p>
<p>We are on the summit of a spur which stands out like a bastion
from the imposing mass of the Cordillera, through the very heart of
which runs the mysterious waterway we have just traversed. Two
thousand feet or more below is a broad plain, bounded on the west
by a range of gaunt and treeless hills ribbed with contorted rocks,
which stretch north and south farther than the eye can reach. The
plain is cultivated and inhabited. There are huts, fields,
orchards, and streams, and about a league from the foot of the
bastion is a large village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pachatupec?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Si, se&ntilde;or</em>, that is Pachatupec, a very
fair land, as you see, and yonder is Pachacamac, where dwells our
queen,&rdquo; said Gondocori, pointing to the village; and then he
fell into a brown study, as if he was not quite sure what to do
next.</p>
<p>The sight of his home did not seem to rejoice the cacique as
much as might be supposed. The approaching interview with Mamcuna
was obviously weighing heavily on his soul, and, to tell the truth,
I rather shared his apprehensions. A savage queen with a sharp
temper who occasionally roasted people alive was not to be trifled
with. But as delay was not likely to help us, and I detest
suspense, and, moreover, felt very hungry, I suggested that we had
better go on to Pachacamac forthwith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had. Yes, let us get it over,&rdquo; he said,
with a sigh.</p>
<p>After descending the bastion by a steep zigzag we turned into a
pleasant foot-path, shaded by trees, and as we neared our
destination we met (among other people) two tall Indians, whose
condor-skull helmets denoted their lordly rank. On recognizing
Gondocori (who had lost his helmet in the snow-storm and looked
otherwise much dilapidated) their surprise was literally
unspeakable. They first stared and then gesticulated. When at
length they found their tongues they overwhelmed him with
questions, eying Gahra and me the while as if we were wild animals.
After a short conversation, of which, being in their own language,
I could only guess the purport, the two caciques turned back and
accompanied us to the village. Save that there was no sign of a
church, it differed little from many other villages which I had met
with in my travels. There were huts, mere roofs on stilts, cottages
of wattle and dab, and flat-roofed houses built of sun-dried
bricks. Streets, there were none, the buildings being all over the
place, as if they dropped from the sky or sprung up hap-hazard from
the ground.</p>
<p>About midway in the village one of the caciques left us to
inform the queen of our arrival and to ask her pleasure as to my
reception. The other cacique asked us into his house, and offered
us refreshments. Of what the dishes set before us were composed I
had only the vaguest idea, but hunger is not fastidious and we ate
with a will.</p>
<p>We had hardly finished when cacique number one, entering in
breathless haste, announced that Queen Mumcuna desired to see us
immediately, whereupon I suggested to Gondocori the expediency of
donning more courtly attire, if there was any to be got.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, keep the queen waiting!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
aghast. &ldquo;She would go mad. Impossible! We must go as we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not wanting her majesty to go mad, I made no further demur, and
we went.</p>
<p>The palace was a large adobe building within a walled inclosure,
guarded by a company of braves with long spears. We were ushered
into the royal presence without either ceremony or delay. The queen
was sitting in a hammock with her feet resting on the ground. She
wore a bright-colored, loosely-fitting bodice, a skirt to match,
and sandals. Her long black hair was arranged in tails, of which
there were seven on each side of her face. She was short and stout,
and perhaps thirty years old, and though in early youth she might
have been well favored, her countenance now bore the impress of
evil passions, and the sodden look of it, as also the blood-streaks
in her eyes, showed that her drink was not always water. At the
same time, it was a powerful face, indicative of a strong character
and a resolute will. Her complexion was bright cinnamon, and the
three or four women by whom she was attended were costumed like
herself.</p>
<p>On entering the room the three caciques went on their knees, and
after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Gahra followed their example. I
thought it quite enough to make my best bow. Mamcuna then motioned
us to draw nearer, and when we were within easy speaking distance
she said something to Gondocori that sounded like a question or a
command, on which he made a long and, as I judged from the vigor of
his gesture and the earnestness of his manner, an eloquent speech.
I watched her closely and was glad to see that though she frowned
once or twice during its delivery, she did not seem very angry. I
also observed that she looked at me much more than at the cacique,
which I took to be a favorable sign. The speech was followed by a
lively dialogue between Mamcuna and the cacique, after which the
latter turned to me and said, as coolly as if he were asking me to
be seated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The queen commands you to strip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commands me to strip! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I say; you have to strip&mdash;undress, take off
your clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joking! I should like to see the man who would dare to
take such a liberty in the audience-chamber of our Great Mother.
Pray don&rsquo;t make words about it, se&ntilde;or. Take off your
clothes without any more bother, or she will be getting
angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her get angry. I shall do nothing of the
sort&mdash;No, don&rsquo;t say that; say that English
gentlemen&mdash;I mean pale-face medicine-men from over the seas,
never undress in the presence of ladies; their religion forbids
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gondocori was about to remonstrate again when the queen
interposed and insisted on knowing what I said. When she heard that
I refused to obey her behest she turned purple with rage, and
looked as if she would annihilate me. Then her mood, or her mind,
changing, she laughed loudly, at the same time pointing to the door
and making an observation to the cacique.</p>
<p>Having meanwhile reflected that I was not in an English
drawing-room, that this wretched woman could have me stripped
whether I would or no, and that refusal to comply with her wishes
might cost me my life, I asked Gondocori why the queen wanted me to
undress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to see whether your body is as hairy as your
face (I had not shaved since I left Naperima), and your face as
fair as your body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it satisfy her if I meet her half-way&mdash;strip to
the waist? You can say that I never did as much for any woman
before, and that I would not do it for the queen of my own country,
whatever might be the consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cacique interpreted my proposal, and Mamcuna smiled assent.
&ldquo;The queen says, &lsquo;let it be as you say;&rsquo; and she
charges me to tell you that she is very much pleased to know that
you will do for her what you would not do for any other
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that I took off my upper garments and Mamcuna, rising from
her hammock, examined me as closely as a military surgeon examines
a freshly caught recruit. She felt the muscles of my arms, thumped
my chest, took note of the width of my back, punched my ribs, and
finally pulled a few hairs out of my beard. Then, smiling approval,
she retired to her chinchura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may put on your clothes; the inspection is
over,&rdquo; said Gondocori. &ldquo;I am glad it has passed off so
well. I was rather afraid, though, when she began to pinch
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the queen is rather curious about skin and color
and that, and does curious things sometimes. She once had a strip
of skin cut out of a mestiza maiden&rsquo;s back, to see whether it
was the same color on both sides. But she seems to have taken quite
a liking for you; says you are the prettiest man she ever saw; and
if you cure her of her illness I have no doubt she will give you a
condor&rsquo;s skull helmet and make you a cacique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am greatly obliged to her Majesty, I am sure, and very
thankful she did not take a fancy to cut a piece out of my back. As
for curing her, I must first of all know what is the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I ask her to describe her symptoms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please.&rdquo; In reply to the questions which I
put, through Gondocori, the queen said that she suffered from
headache, nausea, and sleeplessness, and that, whereas only a few
years ago she was lithe, active, and gay, she was now heavy,
indolent, and melancholy, adding that she had suffered much at the
hands of the late court medicine-man, who did not understand her
case at all, and that to punish him for his ignorance and
presumption she made him swallow a jarful of his own physic, from
the effects of which he shortly afterward expired in great agony.
The place was now vacant, and if I succeeded in restoring her to
health she would make me his successor and always have me near her
person.</p>
<p>I cannot say that I regarded this prospect as particularly
encouraging; nevertheless, I tried to look pleased and told
Gondocori to assure the queen of my gratitude and devotion and ask
her to show me her tongue. He put this request with evident
reluctance, and Mamcuna made an angry reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew how it would be,&rdquo; said the cacique.
&ldquo;You have put her in a rage. She thinks you want to insult
her, and absolutely refuses to make herself hideous by sticking out
her tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will of course do as she pleases. But unless she
shows me her tongue I cannot cure her. I shall not even try. Tell
her so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To tell the truth I had really no great desire to look at the
woman&rsquo;s tongue, but having made the request I meant to stand
to my guns.</p>
<p>After some further parley she yielded, first of all making the
three caciques and Gahra look the other way. The appearance of her
tongue confirmed the theory I had already formed that she was
suffering from dyspepsia, brought on by overeating and a too free
indulgence in the wine of the country (a sort of cider) and
indolent habits.</p>
<p>I said that if she would follow my instructions I had no doubt
that I could not only cure her but make her as lithe and active as
ever she was. Remembering, however, that as even the highly
civilized people object to be made whole without physic and fuss,
and that the queen would certainly not be satisfied with a simple
recommendation to take less food and more exercise, I observed that
before I could say anything further I must gather plants, make
decoctions, and consult the stars, and that my black colleague
should prepare a charm which would greatly increase the potency of
my remedies and the chances of her recovery.</p>
<p>Mamcuna answered that I talked like a medicine-man who
understood his business and her case, that she would strictly obey
my orders, and so soon as she felt better give me a condor&rsquo;s
skull helmet. Meanwhile, I was to take up my quarters in her own
house, and she ordered the caciques to send me forthwith three
suits of clothes, my own, as she rightly remarked, not being
suitable for a man of my position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, did not I tell you?&rdquo; said Gondocori, as we
left the room. &ldquo;Oh, we are going on swimmingly; and it is all
my doing. I do believe that if I had not protested that you were
the greatest medicine-man in the world, and had come expressly to
cure her, she would have had you roasted or ripped up by the
man-killer or turned adrift in the desert, or something equally
diabolical. Your fate is in your own hands now. If you fail to make
good your promises, it will be out of my power to help you. You
heard how she treated your predecessor.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>You are the Man.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>Early next morning I sent Gahra secretly up to the lake on the
bastion for a jar of chalybeate water, which, after being colored
with red earth and flavored with wild garlic, was nauseous enough
to satisfy the most exacting of physic swallowers. Then the negro
sacrificed a cock in the royal presence, and performed an
incantation in the most approved African fashion, and we made the
creature&rsquo;s claws and comb into an amulet, which I requested
the queen to hang round her neck.</p>
<p>This done, I gave my instructions, assuring her that if she
failed in any particular to observe them my efforts would be vain,
and her cure impossible. She was to drink nothing but water and
physic (of the latter very little), eat animal food only once a
day, and that sparingly, and walk two hours every morning; and
finding that she could ride on horseback (like a man), though she
had lately abandoned the exercise, I told her to ride two hours
every evening. I also laid down other rules, purposely making them
onerous and hard to be observed, partly because I knew that a
strict regimen was necessary for her recovery, partly to leave
myself a loop-hole, in the event of her not recovering, for I felt
pretty sure that she would not do all that I had bidden her, and if
she came short in any one thing I should have an excuse ready to my
hand.</p>
<p>But to my surprise she did not come short. For Mamcuna to give
up her cider and her flesh pots, and, flabby and fat as she was, to
walk and ride four hours every day, must have been very hard, yet
she conformed to regulations with rare resolution and self-denial.
As a natural consequence she soon began to mend, at first slowly
and almost imperceptibly, afterward rapidly and visibly, as much to
my satisfaction as hers; for if my treatment had failed, I could
not have said that the fault was hers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I was picking up information about her people, and
acquiring a knowledge of their language, and as I was continually
hearing it spoken I was soon able to make myself understood.</p>
<p>The Pachatupecs, though heathens and savages, were more
civilized than any of the so-called <em>Indios civilizados</em>
with whom I had come in contact. They were clean as to their
persons, bathing frequently, and not filthy in their dwellings;
they raised crops, reared cattle, and wore clothing, which for the
caciques consisted of a tunic of quilted cotton, breeches loose at
the knees, and sandals. The latter virtue may, however, have been
due to the climate, for though the days were warm the nights were
chilly, and the winters at times rather severe, the country being
at a considerable height above the level of the sea. On the other
hand, the Pachatupecs were truculent, gluttonous, and not very
temperate; they practised polygamy, and all the hard work devolved
on the women, whose husbands often brutally ill-used them. It was
contrary to etiquette to ask a man questions about his wives, and
if you went to a cacique&rsquo;s house you were expected either to
ignore their presence or treat them as slaves, as indeed they were,
and the condition of captive Christian girls was even worse than
that of the native women.</p>
<p>Considering the light esteem in which women were held I was
surprised that the Pachatupecs consented to be ruled by one of the
sex. But Gondocori told me that Mamcuna came of a long line of
princes who were supposed to be descended from the Incas, and when
her father died, leaving no male issue, a majority of the caciques
chose her as his successor, in part out of reverence for the race,
in part out of jealousy of each other, and because they thought she
would let them do pretty much as they liked. So far from that,
however, she made them do as she liked, and when some of the
caciques raised a rebellion she took the field in person, beat them
in a pitched battle, and put all the leaders and many of their
followers to death. Since that time there had been no serious
attempt to dispute her authority, which, so far as I could gather,
she used, on the whole, to good purpose. Though cruel and
vindictive, she was also shrewd and resolute, and semi-civilized
races are not ruled with rose-water. She could only maintain order
by making herself feared, and even civilized governments often act
on the principle that the end justifies the means.</p>
<p>Mamcuna had never married because, as she said, there was no man
in the country fit to mate with a daughter of the Incas; but as
Gondocori and some others thought, the man did not exist with whom
she would consent to share her power.</p>
<p>The Pachatupec braves were fine horsemen and expert with the
lasso and the spear and very fine archers. They were bold
mountaineers, too, and occasionally made long forays as far as the
pampas, where, I presume, they had brought the progenitors of the
<em>nandus</em>, of which there were a considerable number in the
country, both wild and tame. The latter were sometimes ridden, but
rather as a feat than a pleasure. The largest flock belonged to the
queen.</p>
<p>By the time I had so far mastered the language as to be able to
converse without much difficulty, the queen had fully regained her
health. This result&mdash;which was of course entirely due to
temperate living and regular exercise&mdash;she ascribed to my
skill, and I was in high favor. She made me a cacique and court
medicine-man; I had quarters in her house, and horses and servants
were always at my disposal. Had her Majesty&rsquo;s gratitude gone
no further than this I should have had nothing to complain of; but
she never let me alone, and I had no peace. I was continually being
summoned to her presence; she kept me talking for hours at a time,
and never went out for a ride or a walk without making me bear her
company. Her attentions became so marked, in fact, that I began to
have an awful fear that she had fallen in love with me. As to this
she did not leave me long in doubt.</p>
<p>One day when I had been entertaining her with an account of my
travels, she startled me by inquiring, <em>&agrave; propos</em> to
nothing in particular, if I knew why she had not married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are a daughter of the Incas, and there is no
man in Pachatupec of equal rank with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once there was not, but now there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I breathed again; she surely could not mean me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is now&mdash;there has been some time,&rdquo; she
continued, after a short pause. &ldquo;Know you who he
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that I had not the slightest idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yourself, se&ntilde;or; you are the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible, Mamcuna! I am of very inferior rank,
indeed&mdash;a common soldier, a mere nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too modest, se&ntilde;or; you do yourself an
injustice. A man with so white a skin, a beard so long, and eyes so
beautiful must be of royal lineage, and fit to mate even with the
daughter of the Incas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite mistaken, Mamcuna; I am utterly unworthy of
so great an honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not, I tell you. Please don&rsquo;t contradict
me, se&ntilde;or&rdquo; (she always called me
&lsquo;se&ntilde;or&rsquo;); &ldquo;it makes me angry. You are the
man whom I delight to honor and desire to wed; what would you have
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;I would not have so much. You are too good;
but it would be wrong. I really cannot let you throw yourself away
on a nameless foreigner. Besides what would your caciques
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any man dare say a word against you I will have his
tongue torn out by the roots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose I am married already&mdash;that I have left a
wife in my own country?&rdquo; I urged in desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would not matter in the least. She is not likely to
come hither, and I will take care that I am your only wife in this
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your condescension quite overwhelms me. But all this is
so sudden; you must really give me a little time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little time! why? You perhaps think I am not sincere,
that I do not mean what I say, that I may change my mind. Have no
fear on that score. There shall be no delay. The preparations for
our wedding shall be begun at once, and ten days hence, dear
se&ntilde;or, you will be my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could I say? I had, of course, no intention of marrying
her&mdash;I would as lief have married a leopardess. But had I
given her a peremptory negative she might have had me laid by the
heels without more ado, or worse. So I bowed my head and held my
tongue, resolving at the same time that, before the expiration of
the ten days&rsquo; respite, I would get out of the country or
perish in the attempt. Whereupon Mamcuna, taking my silence for
consent, showed great delight, patted me on the back, caressed my
beard, fondled my hands, and called me her lord. Fortunately,
kissing was not an institution in Pachatupec.</p>
<p>One good result of our betrothal, if I may so call it, was that
the preparations for the wedding took up so much of Mamcuna&rsquo;s
time that she had none left for me, and I had leisure and
opportunity to contrive a plan of escape, if I could, for, as I
quickly discovered, the difficulties in the way were almost if not
altogether insurmountable. I could neither go back to the eastern
Cordillera by the road I had come, nor, without guides, find any
other pass, either farther north or farther south. Westward was a
range of barren hills bounded by a sandy desert, destitute of life
or the means of supporting life, and stretching to the desolate
Pacific coast, whence, even if I could reach it, I should have no
means of getting away.</p>
<p>There was, moreover, nobody to whom I could appeal for counsel
or help. Gondocori thought me the most fortunate of men, and was
quite incapable of understanding my scruples. Gahra, albeit willing
to go with me, knew no more of the country than I did, and there
was not a man in it who could have been induced even by a bribe
either to act as my guide or otherwise connive at my escape; and I
had no inducement to offer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the opportunity I was looking for came, as
opportunities often do come, spontaneously and unexpectedly, yet in
shape so questionable that it was open to doubt whether, if I
accepted it, my second condition would not be worse than my
first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XXIV" id="Ch_XXIV">Chapter XXIV.</a></h3>
<h2>In the Toils.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Five days after I had been wooed by the irresistible Mamcuna,
and as I was beginning to fear that I should have to marry her
first and run away afterward, I chanced to be riding in the
neighborhood of the village, when a woman darted out of the thicket
and, standing before my horse, held up her arms imploringly. I had
never spoken to her, but I knew her as the white wife of one of the
caciques.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;for
the love of heaven and in the name of our common Christianity, I
implore you to save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From my wretched life, from despair, degradation, and
death.&rdquo; And then she told me that, while travelling in the
mountains with her husband, a certain Se&ntilde;or de la Vega, and
several friends, they were set upon by a band of Pachatupecs who,
after killing all the male members of the party, carried her off
and brought her to Pachacamac, where she had been compelled to
become one of the wives of the cacique Chimu, and that between his
brutality and the jealousy of the other women, her life, apart from
its ignominy, was so utterly wretched that, unless she could
escape, she must either go mad or be driven to commit suicide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be only too glad to rescue you if I could. I
want to escape myself; but how? I see no way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not so difficult as you think, se&ntilde;or; if we
can get horses and a few hours&rsquo; start, I will act as guide
and lead you to a civilized settlement, where we shall be safe from
pursuit. I know the country well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure you can do this, se&ntilde;ora? It
will be a hazardous enterprise, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are prepared to incur the risk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will run any risk rather than stay where I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will see what can be done. Meet me here
to-morrow at this hour. And now, we had better separate; if we are
seen together it will be bad for both of us. <em>Hasta
ma&ntilde;ana</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she went her way and I went mine.</p>
<p>I had said truly &ldquo;a hazardous enterprise.&rdquo; Hazardous
and difficult in any circumstances, the hazard and the difficulty
would be greatly increased by the presence of a woman; and the fact
of a cacique&rsquo;s wife being one of the companions of my flight
would add to the inveteracy of the pursuit. I greatly doubted,
moreover, whether Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega knew the country as well
as she asserted. She was so sick of her wretched condition that she
would say or do anything to get away from it&mdash;and no wonder.
But was I justified in letting her run the risk? The punishment of
a woman who deserted her husband was death by burning; were
Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega caught, this punishment would be
undoubtedly inflicted; were it even suspected that she had met me
or any other man, secretly, Chimu would almost certainly kill her.
Pachatupec husbands had the power of life and death over their
wives, and they were as jealous and as cruel as Moors. Yet death
was better than the life she was compelled to lead, and as she was
fully cognizant of the risk it seemed my duty to do all that I
could to facilitate her escape.</p>
<p>Then another thought occurred to me. Could this be a trap, a
&ldquo;put up job,&rdquo; as the phrase goes. Though the
<em>caciques</em> had not dared to make any open protest against
Mamcuna&rsquo;s matrimonial project, I knew that they were bitterly
opposed to it, and nothing, I felt sure, would please them better
than to kindle the queen&rsquo;s jealousy by making it appear that
I was engaged in an intrigue with one of Chimu&rsquo;s wives.</p>
<p>Yet no, I could not believe it. No Christian woman would play so
base a part. Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega could have no interest in
betraying me. She hated her savage husband too heartily to be the
voluntary instrument of my destruction, and she was so utterly
wretched that I pitied her from my soul.</p>
<p>A creole of pure Spanish blood and noble family, bereft of her
husband, forced to become the slave of a brutal Indian, and the
constant associate of hardly less brutal women, painfully conscious
of her degradation, hopeless of any amendment of her lot, poor
Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega&rsquo;s fate would have touched the
hardest heart. And she had little children at home! My suspicions
vanished even more quickly than they had been conceived, and before
I reached my quarters I had decided that, come what might, the
attempt should be made.</p>
<p>The next question was how and when. Clearly, the sooner the
better; but whether we had better set off at sunrise or sunset was
open to doubt. By leaving at sunset we should be less easily
followed; on the other hand, we should have greater difficulty in
finding our way and be sooner missed. It was generally about sunset
that Mamcuna sent for me, and I knew that at this time it would be
well-nigh impossible for Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega to leave
Chimu&rsquo;s house without being observed and questioned, perhaps
followed. So when we met as agreed, I told her that I had decided
to make the attempt on the next morning, and asked her to be in a
grove of plantains, hard by, an hour before dawn. I besought her,
whatever she did, to be punctual; our lives depended on our
stealing away before people were stirring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Gahra and I had laid our plans. He was to give out the
night before that we were setting off early next morning on a
hunting expedition. This would enable us, without exciting
suspicion, to take a supply of provisions, arms, and a led horse
(for carrying any game we might kill) and, as I hoped, give us a
long start. For even when Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega was missed
nobody would suspect that she had gone with us.</p>
<p>In the event&mdash;as we hoped, the improbable event&mdash;of
our being overtaken or intercepted, Gahra and I were resolved not
to be taken alive; but we had, unfortunately, no firearms; they
were all lost in the snow-storm. Our only weapons were bows and
arrows and machetes. I carried the former merely as a make-believe,
to keep up my character as a hunter; for the same reason we took
with us a brace of dogs. If it came to fighting I should have to
put my trust in my <em>machete</em>, a long broad-bladed sword like
a knife, formidable as a lethal weapon, yet chiefly used for
clearing away brambles and cutting down trees.</p>
<p>All went well at the beginning. We were up betimes and off with
our horses before daylight. The braves on duty asked no questions,
there was no reason why they should, and we passed through the
village without meeting a soul.</p>
<p>So far, good. The omens seemed favorable, and my hopes ran high.
We should get off without anybody knowing which way we had taken,
and several hours before Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega was likely to be
missed.</p>
<p>But when we reached the rendezvous she was not there. I whistled
and called softly; nobody answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be here presently, we must wait,&rdquo; I said
to Gahra.</p>
<p>It was terribly annoying. Every minute was precious. The
Pachatupecs are early risers, and if Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega did
not join us before daylight we might be seen and the opportunity
lost. The sun rose; still she did not come, and I had just made up
my mind to put off our departure until the next morning, and try to
communicate with Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega in the meantime, when
Gahra pointed to a pathway in the wood, where his sharp eyes had
detected the fluttering of a robe.</p>
<p>At last she was coming. But too late. To start at that time
would be madness, and I was about to tell her so, send her back,
and ask her to meet me on the next morning, when she ran forward
with terrified face and uplifted hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me! Save me!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I could not
get away sooner. I have been watched. They are following me, even
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a frightful misfortune, and I feared that the
se&ntilde;ora had acted very imprudently. But it was no time either
for reproaches or regrets, and the words were scarcely out of her
mouth when I lifted her into the saddle; as I did so, I caught
sight of two horsemen and several foot-people, coming down the
pathway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; I said to Gahra, &ldquo;I shall stay
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, se&ntilde;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, I say; as you love me, go at once. This lady is in
your charge. Take good care of her. I can keep these fellows at bay
until you are out of sight and, if possible, I will follow. At
once, please, at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went, Gahra&rsquo;s face expressing the keenest anguish,
the se&ntilde;ora half dead with fear. As they rode away I turned
into the pathway and prepared for the encounter. The foot-people
might do as they liked, they could not overtake the fugitives, but
I was resolved that the horsemen should only pass over my body.</p>
<p>The foremost of them was Chimu himself. When he saw that I had
no intention of turning aside, he and his companion (who rode
behind him) reined in their horses. The cacique was quivering with
rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife has gone off with your negro,&rdquo; he said,
hoarsely.</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you help her to mount. You have met her before.
Mamcuna shall know of this, and my wife shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still I made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drew my <em>machete</em>.</p>
<p>Chimu drew his and came at me, but he was so poor a swordsman,
that I merely played with him, my object being to gain time, and
only when the other fellow tried to push past me and get to my
left-rear, did I cut the cacique down. On this his companion bolted
the way he had come. I galloped after him, more with the intention
of frightening than hurting him, and was just on the point of
turning back and following the fugitives, when something dropped
over my head, my arms were pinioned to my side, and I was dragged
from my saddle.</p>
<p>The foot-people had lassoed me.</p>

<p>I was as helpless as a man in a strait waistcoat. When I tried
to rise, my captors tautened the rope and dragged me along the
ground. Resistance being futile, I resigned myself to my fate.</p>
<p>On seeing what had happened, the flying brave (a kinsman of
Chimu&rsquo;s) returned, and he and the others held a palaver. As
Mamcuna&rsquo;s affianced husband, I was a person of importance,
and they were evidently at a loss how to dispose of me. If they
treated me roughly, they might incur her displeasure. The
discussion was long and rather stormy. In the result, I was asked
whether I would go with them quietly to the queen&rsquo;s house or
be taken thither, <em>nolens volens</em>. On answering that I would
go quietly, I was unbound and allowed to mount my horse.</p>
<p>I do not think I am a coward, and in helping Se&ntilde;ora de la
Vega to escape and sending her off with Gahra, I knew that I had
done the right thing. Yet I looked forward to the approaching
interview with some misgiving. Barbarian though Mamcuna was, I
could not help entertaining a certain respect for her. She had
treated me handsomely; in offering to make me her husband she had
paid me the greatest compliment in her power; and how little soever
you may reciprocate the sentiment, it is impossible to think
altogether unkindly of the woman who has given you her love. And my
conscience was not free from reproach; I had let her think that I
loved her&mdash;as I now perceived, a great mistake. Courageous
herself, she could appreciate courage in others, and had I boldly
and unequivocally refused her offer and given my reasons, I did not
believe she would have dealt hardly with me.</p>
<p>As it was Mamcuna might well say that, having deliberately
deceived her, I deserved the utmost punishment which it was in her
power to inflict. At the same time, I was not without hope that
when she heard my defence she would spare my life.</p>
<p>By the time we reached the queen&rsquo;s house my escort had
swollen into a crowd, and one of the caciques went in to inform
Mamcuna what had befallen and ask for her instructions.</p>
<p>In a few minutes he brought word that the queen would see me and
the people who had taken part in my capture forthwith. We found her
sitting in her <em>chinchura</em>, in the room where she and I
first met. Bather to my surprise she was calm and collected; yet
there was a convulsive twitching of her lips and an angry glitter
in her eyes that boded ill for my hopes of pardon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, this they tell me, se&ntilde;or&mdash;that
you have been helping Chimu&rsquo;s wife to escape, and killed
Chimu?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you prefer this wretched pale-face woman to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mamcuna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, did you help her to escape and kill her
husband? Don&rsquo;t trifle with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I pitied her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chimu treated her ill, and she was very wretched. She
wanted to go back to her own country, and she has little children
at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was her wretchedness to you? Did you not know that
you were incurring my displeasure and risking your own
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. But a Christian caballero holds it his duty to
protect the weak and deliver the oppressed, even at the risk of his
own life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamcuna looked puzzled. The sentiment was too fine for her
comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk foolishness, se&ntilde;or. No man would run into
danger for a woman whom he did not desire to make his
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no desire to make Se&ntilde;ora de la Vega my wife.
I would have done the same for any other woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For any other woman! Would you risk your life for me,
se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Mamcuna, if you were in sorrow or distress and I
could do you any good thereby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well, se&ntilde;or; your voice has the ring of
truth,&rdquo; said the queen, softly, and with a gratified smile,
&ldquo;and inasmuch as you went not away with Chimu&rsquo;s
pale-faced wife, but let her depart with the
negro&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The se&ntilde;or would have gone also had we not hindered
him,&rdquo; interposed Chimu&rsquo;s kinsman. &ldquo;We saw him
lift the woman into the saddle, and he was turning to follow her
when Lurin caught him with the lasso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this true; would you have gone with the woman?&rdquo;
asked the queen, sternly, her smile changing into an ominous
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true; but let me explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough; I will not hear another word. So you would have
left me, a daughter of the Incas, who have honored you above all
other men, and gone away with a woman you say you do not love! Your
heart is full of deceit, your mouth runs over with lies. You shall
die; so shall the white woman and the black slave. Where are they?
Bring them hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caciques and braves who were present stared at each other in
consternation. In their exultation and excitement over my capture
the fugitives had been forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mules! Idiots! Old women! Follow them and bring them
back. They shall be burned in the same fire. As for you,
se&ntilde;or, because you cured me of my sickness and were to have
been my husband I will let you choose the method of your death. You
may either be roasted before a slow fire, hacked to pieces with
<em>machetes</em>, or fastened on the back of the man-killer and
sent to perish in the desert. Choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one word of explanation, Mamcuna. I would
fain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! or I will have your tongue torn out by the
roots. Choose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I choose the man-killer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it will be an easier death than being hacked to
pieces. You are wrong. The vultures will peck out your eyes, and
you will die of hunger and thirst. But as you have said so let it
be. Tie him to the back of the man-killer, men, and chase it into
the desert. If you let him escape you die in his place. But treat
him with respect; he was nearly my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Mamcuna, sinking back into her <em>chinchura</em>,
covered her face with her hands; but she showed no sign of
relenting, and I was bound with ropes and hurried from the
room.</p>
<p>The man-killer was a nandu<sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote">1.
The American ostrich.</span> belonging to the queen, and had gained
his name by killing one man and maiming several others who unwisely
approached him when he was in an evil temper. Save for an
occasional outburst of homicidal mania and his abnormal size and
strength, the man-killer did not materially differ from the other
nandus of Mamcuna&rsquo;s flock. His keeper controlled the bird
without difficulty, and I had several times seen him mount and ride
it round an inclosure.</p>
<p>The desert, as I have already mentioned, lies between the
Cordillera and the Pacific Ocean, stretching almost the entire
length of the Peruvian coast, with here and there an oasis watered
by one or other of the few streams which do not lose themselves in
the sand before they reach the sea. It is a rainless, hideous
region of naked rocks and whirling sands, destitute of fresh water
and animal life, a region into which, except for a short distance,
the boldest traveller cares not to venture.</p>
<p>After leaving the queen&rsquo;s house I was placed in charge of
a party of braves commanded by a cacique, and we set out for the
place where my expiation was to begin. The nandu, led by his keeper
and another man, of course went with us. My conductors, albeit they
made no secret of their joy over my downfall, did their
mistress&rsquo;s bidding, and treated me with respect. They loosed
my bonds, taking care, however, so to guard me as to render escape
impossible, and, when we halted, gave me to eat and drink. But
their talk was not encouraging. In their opinion, nothing could
save me from a horrible death, probably of thirst. The best that I
could hope for was being smothered in a sandstorm. The man-killer
would probably go on till he dropped from exhaustion, and then,
whether I was alive or dead, birds of prey would pick out my eyes
and tear the flesh from my bones.</p>
<p>About midday we reached the mountain range which divides
Pachatupec from the desert. Anything more lonesome and depressing
it were impossible to conceive. Not a tree, not a shrub, not a
blade of grass nor any green thing; neither running stream nor
gleam of water could be seen. It was a region in which the blessed
rain of heaven had not fallen for untold ages, a region of
desolation and death, of naked peaks, rugged precipices, and rocky
ravines. The heat from the overhead sun, intensified by the
reverberations from the great masses of rock around us, and
unrelieved by the slightest breath of air, was well-nigh
suffocating.</p>
<p>Into this plutonic realm we plunged, and, after a scorching
ride, reached the head of a pass which led straight down to the
desert. Here the cacique in command of the detachment told me,
rather to my surprise, that we were to part company. They were
already a long way from home and saw no reason why they should go
farther. The desert, albeit four or five leagues distant, was quite
visible, and, once started down the pass, the nandu would be bound
to go thither. He could not climb the rocks to the right or the
left, and the braves would take care that he did not return.</p>
<p>As objection, even though I had felt disposed to make it, would
have been useless, I bowed acquiescence. The thought of resisting
had more than once crossed my mind, and, by dint of struggling and
fighting, I might have made the nandu so restive that I could not
have been fastened on his back. But in that case my second
condition would have been worse than my first; I should have been
taken back to Pachatupec and either burned alive or hacked to
pieces, and, black as seemed the outlook, I clung to the hope that
the man-killer would somehow be the means of saving my life.</p>
<p>The binding was effected with considerable difficulty. It
required the united strength of nearly all the braves to hold the
nandu while the cacique and the keepers secured me on his back. As
he was let go he kicked out savagely, ripping open with his
terrible claws one of the men who had been holding him. The next
moment he was striding down the steep and stony pass at a speed
which, in a few minutes, left the pursuing and shouting Pachatupecs
far behind. The ground was so rough and the descent so rapid that I
expected every moment we should come to grief. But on we went like
the wind. Never in my life, except in an express train, was I
carried so fast. The great bird was either wild with rage or under
the impression that he was being hunted. The speed took my breath
away; the motion make me sick. He must have done the fifteen miles
between the head of the pass and the beginning of the desert in
little more than as many minutes. Then, the ground being covered
with sand and comparatively level, the nandu slacked his speed
somewhat, though he still went at a great pace.</p>
<p>The desert was a vast expanse of white sand, the glare of which,
in the bright sunshine, almost blinded me, interspersed with
stretches of rock, swept bare by the wind, and loose stones.</p>
<p>Instead of turning to the right or left, that is to say, to the
north or south, as I hoped and expected he would, the man-killer
ran straight on toward the sea. As for the distance of the coast
from that part of the Cordillera I had no definite
idea&mdash;perhaps thirty miles, perhaps fifty, perhaps more. But
were it a hundred we should not be long in going thither at the
speed we were making; and vague hopes, suggesting the possibility
of signalling a passing ship or getting away by sea, began to shape
themselves in the mind. The nandu could not go on forever; before
reaching the sea he must either alter his course or stop, and if he
stopped only a few minutes and so gave me a chance of steadying
myself I thought that, by the help of my teeth, I might untie one
of the cords which the movements of the bird and my own efforts had
already slightly loosened, and once my arms were freed the rest
would be easy.</p>
<p>An hour (as nearly as I could judge) after leaving the
Cordillera I sighted the Pacific&mdash;a broad expanse of blue
water shining in the sun and stretching to the horizon. How eagerly
I looked for a sail, a boat, the hut of some solitary fisherman, or
any other sign of human presence! But I saw nothing save water and
sand; the ocean was as lonesome as the desert. There was no
salvation thitherward.</p>
<p>Though my hope had been vague, my disappointment was bitter; but
a few minutes later all thought of it was swallowed up in a new
fear. The sea was below me, and as the ground had ceased to fall I
knew that the desert must end on that side in a line of lofty
cliffs. I knew, also, that nandus are among the most stupid of
bipeds, and it was just conceivable that the man-killer, not
perceiving his danger until too late, might go over the cliffs into
the sea.</p>
<p>The hoarse roar of the waves as they surge against the rocks, at
first faint, grows every moment louder and deeper. I see distinctly
the land&rsquo;s end, and mentally calculate from the angle it
makes with the ocean, the height of the cliffs.</p>
<p>Still the man-killer strides on, as straight as an arrow and as
resolutely as if a hundred miles of desert, instead of ten thousand
miles of water, stretched before him. Three minutes more
and&mdash;I set my teeth hard and draw a deep breath. At any rate,
it will be an easier end than burning, or dying of
thirst&mdash;Another moment and&mdash;</p>
<p>But now the nandu, seeing that he will soon be treading the air,
makes a desperate effort to stop short, in which failing he wheels
half round, barely in time to save his life and mine, and then
courses madly along the brink for miles, as if unable to tear
himself away, keeping me in a state of continual fear, for a single
slip, or an accidental swerve to the right, and we should have
fallen headlong down the rocks, against which the waves are
beating.</p>
<p>As night closes in he gradually&mdash;to my inexpressible
relief&mdash;draws inland, making in a direction that must sooner
or later take us back to the Cordillera, though a long way south of
the pass by which we had descended to the desert. But I have hardly
sighted the outline of the mighty barrier, looming portentously in
the darkness, when he alters his course once again, wenching this
time almost due south. And so he continues for hours, seldom going
straight, now inclining toward the coast, anon facing toward the
Cordillera but always on the southward tack, never turning to the
north.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful night. The splendor of the purple sky with
its myriads of lustrous stars was in striking contrast with the
sameness of the white and deathlike desert. A profound melancholy
took hold of me. I had ceased to fear, almost to think, my
perceptions were blinded by excitement and fatigue, my spirits
oppressed by an unspeakable sense of loneliness and helplessness,
and the awful silence, intensified rather than relieved by the long
drawn moaning of the unseen ocean, which, however far I might be
from it, was ever in my ears.</p>
<p>I looked up at the stars, and when the cross began to bend I
knew that midnight was past, and that in a few hours would dawn
another day. What would it bring me&mdash;life or death? I hardly
cared which; relief from the torture and suspense I was enduring
would be welcome, come how it might. For I suffered cruelly; I had
a terrible thirst. The cords chafed my limbs and cut into my flesh.
Every movement gave an exquisite pain; I was continually on the
rack; rest, even for a moment, was impossible, as, though the nandu
had diminished his speed, he never stopped. And then a wind came up
from the sea, bringing with it clouds of dust, which well-nigh
choked and half blinded me; filled my ears and intensified my
thirst. After a while a strange faintness stole over me; I felt as
if I were dying, my eyes closed, my head sank on my breast, and I
remembered no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Regardez mon p&egrave;re, regardez! Il va mieux, le
pauvre homme.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>C&rsquo;est &ccedil;a, ma fille ch&eacute;rie, faites
le boire.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I open my eyes with an effort, for the dust of the desert has
almost blinded me.</p>
<p>I am in a beautiful garden, leaning against the body of the dead
ostrich, a lovely girl is holding a cup of water to my parched
lips, and an old man of benevolent aspect stands by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Merci mademoiselle, vous etes bien bonne</em>,&rdquo;
I murmur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, he speaks French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This passes comprehension. Are you French,
monsieur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;English! This is stranger still. But whence come you, and
who bound you on the nandu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you&mdash;a little more water, I pray you,
mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him drink again, Angela&mdash;and dash some water in
his face; he is faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Le pauvre homme!</em> See how his lips are swollen!
Do you feel better, monsieur?&rdquo; she asked compassionately,
again putting the cup to my lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much. A thousand thanks. I can answer your question now
(to the old man). I was bound on the nandu by order of the Queen of
the Pachatupec Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pachatupec Indians! I have heard of them. But they
are a long way off; more than a hundred leagues of desert lies
between us and the Pachatupec country. Are you quite sure,
monsieur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite. And seeing that the nandu went at great speed,
though not always in a direct line, and we must have been going
fifteen or sixteen hours, I am not surprised that we have travelled
so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon dieu!</em> And all that time you have neither
eaten nor drunk. No wonder you are exhausted! Come with us, and we
will give you something more invigorating than water. You shall
tell us your story afterward&mdash;if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to rise, but my stiffened and almost paralyzed limbs
refused to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us help you. Take his other arm, Angela&mdash;thus,
Now!&rdquo; And with that they each gave me a hand and raised me to
my feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it? Who killed the nandu?&rdquo; I asked as I
hobbled on between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw the creature coming toward us with what looked
like a dead man on his back, and as he did not seem disposed to
stop I told Angela, who is a famous archer, to draw her bow and
shoot him. He fell dead where he now lies, and when we saw that,
though unconscious, you still lived, we unloosed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And saved my life. Might I ask to whom I am indebted for
this great service, and to what beautiful country the nandu has
brought me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say nothing about the service, my dear sir. Helping each
other in difficulty and distress is a duty we owe to Heaven and our
common humanity. I count your coming a great blessing. You are the
first visitor we have had for many years, and the Abb&eacute;
Balthazar gives you a warm welcome to San Cristobal de Quipai. The
name is of good omen, Quipai being an Indian word which signifies
&lsquo;Rest Here,&rsquo; and I shall be glad for you to rest here
so long as it may please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigel Fortescue, formerly an officer in the British Army,
at present a fugitive and a wanderer, tenders you his warmest
thanks, and gratefully accepts your hospitality&mdash;And now that
we know each other, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;, might I ask the
favor of an introduction to the young lady to whom I owe my
deliverance from the nandu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is Angela, monsieur. My people call her
Se&ntilde;orita Angela. It pleases me sometimes to speak of her as
Angela Dieu-donn&eacute;e, for she was sent to us by God, and ever
since she came among us she has been our good angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure she has. Nobody with so sweet a face could be
otherwise than good,&rdquo; I said, with an admiring glance at the
beautiful girl which dyed the damask of her cheek a yet deeper
crimson.</p>
<p>It was no mere compliment. In all my wanderings I have not
beheld the equal of Angela Dieu-donn&eacute;e. Though I can see her
now, though I learned to paint in order that, however inadequately,
I might make her likeness, I am unable to describe her; words can
give no idea of the comeliness of her face, the grace of her
movements, and the shapeliness of her form. I have seen women with
skins as fair, hair as dark, eyes as deeply blue, but none with the
same brightness of look and sweetness of disposition, none with
courage as high, temper as serene.</p>
<p>To look at Angela was to love her, though as yet I knew not that
I had regained my liberty only to lose my heart. My feelings at the
moment oscillated between admiration of her and a painful sense of
my own disreputable appearance. Bareheaded and shoeless, covered
with the dust of the desert, clad only in a torn shirt and ragged
trousers, my arms and legs scored with livid marks, I must have
seemed a veritable scarecrow. Angela looked like a queen, or would
have done were queens ever so charming, or so becomingly attired.
Her low-crowned hat was adorned with beautiful flowers; a
loose-fitting alpaca robe of light blue set off her form to the
best advantage, and round her waist was a golden baldrick which
supported a sheaf of arrows. At her breast was an orchid which in
Europe would have been almost priceless, her shapely arms were bare
to the shoulder, and her sandaled feet were innocent of hosen.</p>
<p>I was wondering who could have designed this costume, in which
there was a savor of the pictures of Watteau and the court of
Versailles, how so lovely a creature could have found her way to a
place so remote as San Cristobal de Quipai, when the abb&eacute;
resumed the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angela came to us as strangely and unexpectedly as you
have come, Monsieur Nigel&rdquo; (he found my Christian name the
easier to pronounce), &ldquo;and, like you, without any volition on
her part or previous knowledge of our existence. But there is this
difference between you: she came as a little child, you come as a
grown man. Sixteen years ago we had several severe earthquakes.
They did us little harm down here, but up on the Cordillera they
wrought fearful havoc, and the sea rose and there was a great
storm, and several ships were dashed to pieces against our
iron-bound coast, which no mariner willingly approaches. The
morning after the tempest there was found on the edge of the cliffs
a cot in which lay a rosy-cheeked babe. How it came to pass none
could tell, but we all thought that the cot must have been fastened
to a board, which became detached from the cot at the very moment
when the sea threw it on the land. The babe was just able to lisp
her name&mdash;&lsquo;Angela,&rsquo; which corresponded with the
name embroidered on her clothing. This is all we know about her;
and I greatly fear that those to whom she belonged perished in the
storm. Even the wreckage that was washed ashore furnished no clew;
it was part of two different vessels. The little waif was brought
to me and with me she has ever since remained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will always remain, dear father,&rdquo; said Angela,
regarding the old priest with loving reverence. &ldquo;All that I
lost in the storm has he been to me&mdash;father, mother,
instructor, and friend. You see here, monsieur, the best and wisest
man in all the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had so wide an experience of the world and of
men, <em>mignonne</em>!&rdquo; returned the abb&eacute;, with an
amused smile. &ldquo;Sir, since she could speak she has seen two
white men. You are the second.&mdash;Ah, well, if I were not afraid
you would think we had constituted ourselves into a mutual
admiration society I should be tempted to say something even more
complimentary about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;, say it, I pray
you,&rdquo; I exclaimed, eagerly, for it pleased me more than I can
tell to hear him sound Angela&rsquo;s praises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I would rather you learned to appreciate her from
your own observation. Yet I will say this much. She is the
brightness of my life, the solace of my old age, and so good that
even praise does not spoil her. But you look tired; shall we sit
down on this fallen log and rest a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this proposal I gladly assented, for I was spent with fatigue
and faint with hunger. Angela, however, after glancing at me
compassionately and saying she would be back in a few minutes, went
a little farther and presently returned with a bunch of grapes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat these,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they will refresh
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a simple act of kindness; but a simple act of kindness,
gracefully performed, is often an index of character, and I felt
sure that the girl had a kind heart and deserved all the praise
bestowed on her by the abb&eacute;.</p>
<p>I was thanking her, perhaps more warmly than the occasion
required, when she stopped the flow of my eloquence by reminding me
that I had not yet told them why the Indian queen caused me to be
fastened on the back of the <em>nandu</em>.</p>
<p>On this hint I spoke, and though the abb&eacute; suggested that
I was too tired for much talking, I not only answered the question
but briefly narrated the main facts of my story, reserving a fuller
account for a future occasion.</p>
<p>Both listened with rapt attention; but of the two Angela was the
more eager listener. She several times interrupted me with requests
for information as to matters which even among European children
are of common knowledge, for, though the abb&eacute; was a man of
high learning and she an apt pupil, her experience of life was
limited to Quipai; and he had been so long out of the world that he
had almost forgotten it. As for news, he was worse off than Fray
Ignacio. He had heard of the First Consul but nothing of the
Emperor Napoleon, and when I told him of the restoration of the
Bourbons he shed tears of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, fervently, &ldquo;France
is once more ruled by a son of St. Louis. The tricolor is replaced
by the <em>fleur-de-lis</em>. You are our second good angel,
Monsieur Fortescue; you bring us glad tidings of great
joy&mdash;You smile, but I am persuaded that Providence has led you
hither in so strange a way for some good purpose, and as I venture
to hope, in answer to my prayers; for albeit our lives here are so
calm and happy, and I have been the means of bringing a great work
to a successful issue, it is not in the nature of things that men
should be free from care, and my mind has lately been troubled with
forebodings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never told me, father!&rdquo; said Angela,
reproachfully. &ldquo;What are they, these forebodings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you be worried with an old man&rsquo;s
difficulties? One has reference to my people, the other&mdash;but
never mind the other. It may be that already a way has been
opened.&mdash;If you feel sufficiently rested, Monsieur Nigel, I
think we had better proceed. A short walk will bring us to San
Cristobal, and it would be well for us to get thither before the
heat of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I protested that the rest and the bunch of grapes had so much
refreshed me that I felt equal to a long walk, and we moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a splendid garden!&rdquo; I exclaimed for the third
or fourth time as we entered an alley festooned with trailing
flowers and grape-vines from which the fruit hung in thick
clusters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Quipai is a garden,&rdquo; said the abb&eacute;,
proudly. &ldquo;We have fruit and flowers and cereals all the year
round, thanks to the great <em>azequia</em> (aqueduct) which the
Incas built and I restored. And such fruit! Let him taste a
<em>chirimoya ma fille ch&egrave;rie</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a tree about fifteen feet high Angela plucked a round green
fruit, not unlike an apple, but covered with small knobs and
scales. Then she showed me how to remove the skin, which covered a
snow-white juicy pulp of exquisite fragrance and a flavor that I
hardly exaggerated in calling divine. It was a fruit fit for the
gods, and so I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We owe it all to the great <em>azequia</em>,&rdquo;
observed the abb&eacute;. &ldquo;See, it feeds these rills and
fills those fountains, waters our fields, and makes the desert
bloom like the rose and the dry places rejoice. And we have not
only fruit and flowers, but corn, coffee, cocoa, yuccas, potatoes,
and almost every sort of vegetable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quipai is a land of plenty and a garden of
delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most apt description, and so long as the great
<em>azequia</em> is kept in repair and the system of irrigation
which I have established is maintained it will remain a land of
plenty and a garden of delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if any harm should befall the
<em>azequia</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, and if our water-supply were to fail,
Quipai, as you see it now, would cease to exist. The desert, which
we are always fighting and have so far conquered, would regain the
mastery, and the mission become what I found it, a little oasis at
the foot of the Cordillera, supporting with difficulty a few score
families of naked Indians. One of these days, if you are so
disposed, you shall follow the course of the <em>azequia</em> and
see for yourself with what a marvellous reservoir, fed by Andean
snows, Nature has provided us. But more of this another time. Look!
Yonder is San Cristobal, our capital as I sometimes call it, though
little more than a village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The abb&eacute; said truly. It was little more than a village;
but as gay, as picturesque, and as bright as a scene in an
opera&mdash;two double rows of painted houses forming a large oval,
the space between them laid out as a garden with straight walks and
fountains and clipped shrubs, after the fashion of Versailles; in
the centre a church and two other buildings, one of which, as the
abb&eacute; told me, was a school, the other his own dwelling.</p>
<p>The people we met saluted him with great humility, and he
returned their salutations quite <em>en grand seigneur</em>, even,
as I thought, somewhat haughtily. One woman knelt in the road,
kissed his hand, and asked for his blessing, which he gave like the
superior being she obviously considered him. It was the same in the
village. Everybody whom we met or passed stood still and uncovered.
There could be no question who was master in San Cristobal.
Abb&eacute; Balthazar was both priest and king, and, as I afterward
came to know, there was every reason why he should be.</p>
<p>He kept a large establishment, for the country, and lived in
considerable state. On entering his house, which was surrounded by
a veranda and embowered in trees, the abb&eacute;, asked if I would
like a bath, and on my answering in the affirmative ordered one of
the servants, all of whom spoke Spanish, to take me to the
bath-room and find me a suit of clothes.</p>
<p>The bath made me feel like another man, and the fresh garments
effected as great a change in my personal appearance. There was not
much difficulty about the fit. A cotton undershirt, a blue jacket
with silver buttons, a red sash, white breeches, loose at the knee,
and a pair of sandals, and I was fully attired. Stockings I had to
dispense with. They were not in vogue at San Cristobal.</p>
<p>When I was ready, the servant, who had acted as my valet,
conducted me to the dining-room, where I found Angela and the
abb&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Parbleu!</em>&rdquo; exclaimed the latter, who
occasionally indulged in expressions that were not exactly
clerical. &ldquo;<em>Parbleu!</em> I had no idea that a bath and
clean raiment could make so great an improvement in a man&rsquo;s
appearance. That costume becomes you to admiration, Monsieur Nigel.
Don&rsquo;t you think so, Angela?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget, father, that he is the only caballero I ever
saw. Are all caballeros like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very few, I should say. It is a long time since I saw
any; but even at the court of Louis XV. I do not remember seeing
many braver looking gentlemen than our guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment Angela gave me a
quick glance, blushed deeply, and then, turning to the abb&eacute;,
proposed that we should take our places at the table.</p>
<p>I was so hungry that even an indifferent meal would have seemed
a luxurious banquet, but the repast set before us might have
satisfied an epicure. We had a delicious soup, something like
mutton-cutlets, land-turtle steaks, and capon, all perfectly
cooked; vegetables and fruit in profusion, and the wine was as good
as any I had tasted in France or Spain. After dinner coffee was
served and the abb&eacute; inquired whether I would retire to my
room and have a sleep, or smoke a cigarette with him and Angela on
the veranda.</p>
<p>In ordinary circumstances I should probably have preferred to
sleep; but I was so fascinated with Mademoiselle
Dieu-donn&eacute;e, so excited by all that I had seen and heard, so
curious to know the history of this French priest, who talked of
the court of Louis XV., who had created a country and a people, and
contrived, in a region so remote from civilization, to surround
himself with so many luxuries, that I elected without hesitation
for the cigarettes and the veranda.</p>

<h2>Abb&eacute; Balthazar.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Though my wounds had not ceased their smarting nor my bones
their aching my happiness was complete. The splendid prospect
before me, the glittering peaks of the Cordillera, the gleaming
waters of the far Pacific, the gardens and fountains of San
Cristobal, the charm of Angela&rsquo;s presence, and the
abb&eacute;&rsquo;s conversation made me oblivious to the past and
careless of the future. The hardships and perils I had lately
undergone, my weary wanderings in the wilderness, the dull monotony
of the Happy Valley, the passage of the Andes, my terrible ride on
the <em>nandu</em>, all were forgotten. The contrast between my
by-gone miseries and present surroundings added zest to my
enjoyment. I felt as one suddenly transported from Hades to
Elysium, and it required an effort to realize that it was not all a
dream, destined to end in a rude awaking.</p>
<p>After some talk about Europe, the revolt of the Spanish
colonies, and my recent adventures, the abb&eacute; gave me an
account of his life and adventures. The scion of a noble French
family, he had been first a page of honor at Versailles, then an
officer of the <em>garde du corps</em>, and among the gayest of the
gay. But while yet a youth some terrible event on which he did not
like to dwell&mdash;a disastrous love affair, a duel in which he
killed one who had been his friend&mdash;wrought so radical a
change in his character and his ideals that he resigned his
commission, left the court, and joined the Society of Jesus, under
the name of Balthazar. Being a noble he became an abb&eacute;
(though he had never an abbey) as a matter of course, and full of
religious ardor and thirsting for distinction in his new calling he
volunteered to go out as a missionary among the wild tribes of
South America.</p>
<p>After long wanderings, and many hardships, Balthazar and two
fellow priests accidentally discovered Quipai, at that time a mere
collection of huts on the banks of a small stream which descended
from the gorges of the Cordillera only to be lost in the sands of
the desert. But all around were remains which showed that Quipai
had once been a place of importance and the seat of a large
population&mdash;ruined buildings of colossal dimensions, heaps of
quarried stones, a cemetery rich in relics of silver and gold; and
a great <em>azequia</em>, in many places still intact, had brought
down water from the heart of the mountains for the irrigation of
the rainless region of the coast.</p>
<p>Balthazar had moreover heard of the marvellous system of
irrigation whereby the Incas had fertilized nearly the whole of the
Peruvian desert; and as he surveyed the ruins he conceived the
great idea of restoring the aqueduct and repeopling the neighboring
waste. To this task he devoted his life. His first proceeding was
to convert the Indians and found a mission, which he called San
Cristobal de Quipai; his next to show them how to make the most of
the water-privileges they already possessed. A reservoir was built,
more land brought under cultivation, and the oasis rendered capable
of supporting a larger population. The resulting prosperity and the
abb&eacute;&rsquo;s fame as a physician (he possessed a fair
knowledge of medicine) drew other Indians to Quipai.</p>
<p>After a while the gigantic undertaking was begun, and little by
little, and with infinite patience and pain accomplished. It was a
work of many years, and when I travelled the whole length of the
<em>azequia</em> I marvelled greatly how the abb&eacute;, with the
means at his command, could have achieved an enterprise so arduous
and vast. The aqueduct, nearly twenty leagues in length, extended
from the foot of the snow-line to a valley above Quipai, the water
being taken thence in stone-lined canals and wooden pipes to the
seashore. In several places the <em>azequia</em> was carried on
lofty arches over deep ravines: and there were two great
reservoirs, both remarkable works. The upper one was the crater of
an extinct volcano, of unknown depth, which contained an immense
quantity of water. It took so long to fill that the abb&eacute;, as
he laughingly told me, began to think that there must be a hole in
the bottom. But in the end it did fill to the very brim, and always
remained full. The second reservoir, a dammed up valley, was just
below the first; it served to break the fall from the higher to the
lower level and receive the overflow from the crater.</p>
<p>A bursting of either of the reservoirs was quite out of the
question; at any rate the abb&eacute; so assured me, and certainly
the crater looked strong enough to hold all the water in the Andes,
could it have been got therein, while the lower reservoir was so
shallow&mdash;the out-flow and the loss by evaporation being equal
to the in-take&mdash;that even if the banks were to give way no
great harm could be done.</p>
<p>I mention these particulars because they have an important
bearing on events that afterward befell, and on my own destiny.</p>
<p>Only a born engineer and organizer of untiring energy and
illimitable patience could have performed so herculean a labor.
Balthazar was all this, and more. He knew how to rule men
despotically yet secure their love. The Indians did his bidding
without hesitation and wrought for him without pay. In the absence
of this quality his task had never been done. On the other hand, he
owed something to fortune. All the materials were ready to his
hand. He built with the stone quarried by the Incas. His work
suffered no interruption from frost or snow or rain. His very
isolation was an advantage. He had neither enemies to fear, friends
to please, nor government officers to propitiate.</p>
<p>On the landward side Quipai was accessible only by difficult and
little known mountain-passes which nobody without some strong
motive would care to traverse, and passing ships might be trusted
to give a wide berth to an iron-bound coast destitute alike of
harbors and trade.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that, albeit the mission of Quipai was in the
dominion of the King of Spain, none of his agents knew of its
existence, his writs did not run there, and Balthazar treated the
royal decree for the expulsion of the Jesuits from South America
(of which he heard two or three years after its promulgation) with
the contempt that he thought it deserved. Nevertheless, he deemed
it the part of prudence to maintain his isolation more rigidly than
ever, and make his communications with the outer world few and far
between, for had it become known to the captain-general of Peru
that there was a member of the proscribed order in his
vice-royalty, even at so out of the way a place as Quipai he would
have been sent about his business without ceremony. The possibility
of this contingency was always in the abb&eacute;&rsquo;s mind. For
a time it caused him serious disquiet; but as the years went on and
no notice was taken of him his mind became easier. The news I
brought of the then recent events in Spain and the revolt of her
colonies made him easier. The viceroy would have too many irons in
the fire to trouble himself about the mission of Quipai and its
chief, even if they should come to his knowledge, which was to the
last degree improbable. We sat talking for several hours, and
should probably have talked longer had not the abb&eacute; kindly
yet peremptorily insisted on my retiring to rest.</p>
<p>Early next morning we started on an excursion to the valley
lake, each of us mounted on a fine mule from the
abb&eacute;&rsquo;s stables, and attended by an <em>arriero</em>.
North as well as south of San Cristobal (as the village was
generally called) the country had the same garden-like aspect.
There was none of the tangled vegetation which in tropical forests
impedes the traveller&rsquo;s progress; except where they had been
planted by the roadside for protection from the sun, or bent over
the water-courses, the trees grew wide apart like trees in a park.
Men and women were busy in the fields and plantations, for the
abb&eacute; had done even a more wonderful thing than restoring the
great <em>azequia</em>&mdash;converted a tribe of indolent
aborigines into an industrious community of husbandmen and
craftsmen; among them were carpenters, smiths, masons, weavers,
dyers, and cunning workers in silver and gold. The secret of his
power was the personal ascendancy of a strong man, the naturally
docile character of his converts, the inflexible justice which
characterized all his dealings with them, and the belief
assiduously cultivated, that as he had been their benefactor in
this world he could control their destinies in the next. Though he
never punished he was always obeyed, and there was probably not a
man or woman under his sway who would have hesitated to obey him,
even to death.</p>
<p>The lake was small yet picturesque, its verdant banks deepening
by contrast the dark desolation of the arid mountains in which it
was embosomed. Some three thousand feet above it rose the extinct
volcano, the slopes of which in the days of the Incas were terraced
and cultivated. Angela and I half rode, half walked to the top; but
the abb&eacute;, on the plea that he had some business to look
after, stayed at the bottom.</p>
<p>The crater was about eight hundred yards in diameter and filled
nearly to the brim with crystal water, which outflowed by a wide
and well made channel into the lake, the supply being kept up by
the in-flow from the <em>azequia</em>, whose course we could trace
far into the mountains.</p>
<p>The view from our coigne of vantage was unspeakably grand.
Behind us rose the stupendous range of the Andes, with its
snow-white peaks and smoking volcanoes; before us the oasis of
Quipai rolled like a river of living green to the shores of the
measureless ocean, whose shining waters in that clear air and under
that azure sky seemed only a few miles away, while, as far as the
eye could reach, the coast-line was fringed with the dreary waste
where I had so nearly perished.</p>
<p>The oasis, as I now for the first time discovered, was a valley,
a broad shallow depression in the desert falling in a gentle slope
from the foot of the Cordillera to the sea, whereby its irrigation
was greatly facilitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful Quipai looks, and how like a river!&rdquo;
said Angela. &ldquo;That is what I always think when I come
here&mdash;how like a river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows that long ago the valley was not the bed of a
river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be very long ago, then, before there was any
Cordillera. Rain-clouds never cross the Andes, and for untold ages
there can have been no rain here on the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. Without rain you cannot have much of a
river, and if the <em>azequia</em> were to fail there would be very
little left of Quipai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suggest anything so dreadful as the failure
of the <em>azequia</em>. It is the Palladium of the mission and the
source of all our prosperity and happiness. Besides, how could it
fail? You see how solidly it is built, and every month it is
carefully inspected from end to end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be destroyed by an earthquake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are pleased to be a Job&rsquo;s comforter, Monsieur
Nigel. Damaged it might be, but hardly destroyed, except in some
cataclysm which would destroy everything, and that is a risk which,
like all dwellers in countries subject to earthquakes, we must run.
We cannot escape from the conditions of our existence; and life is
so pleasant here, we are spared so many of the miseries which
afflict our fellow-creatures in other parts of the world&mdash;war,
pestilence, strife, and want&mdash;that it were as foolish and
ungrateful to make ourselves unhappy because we are exposed to some
remote danger against which we cannot guard, as to repine because
we cannot live forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You discourse most excellent philosophy, Mademoiselle
Angela.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without knowing it, then, as Monsieur Jourdan talked
prose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So! You have read Moli&egrave;re?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over and over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must have a library at San Cristobal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very small one, as you may suppose; but a small library
is not altogether a disadvantage, as the abb&eacute; says. The
fewer books you have the oftener you read them; and it is better to
read a few books well than many superficially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The abb&eacute; has been your sole teacher, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has been! He is still. He has even written books for me,
and he is the author of some of the best I possess&mdash;But
don&rsquo;t you think, monsieur, we had better descend to the
valley? The abb&eacute; will have finished his business by this
time, and though he is the best man in the world he has the fault
of kings; he does not like to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>I Bid You Stay.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been here a month, Monsieur Nigel, living in
close intimacy with Angela and myself,&rdquo; said the abb&eacute;,
as we sat on the veranda sipping our morning coffee. &ldquo;You
have mixed with our people, seen our country, and inspected the
great <em>azequia</em> in its entire length. Tell me, now, frankly,
what do you think of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never passed so happy a month in my life,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so, very glad. My question,
however, referred not to your feelings but your opinion. I will
repeat it: What think you of Quipai and its
institutions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of but one institution in Quipai, and I admire it
more than I can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yourself, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The abb&eacute; smiled as if the compliment pleased him, but the
next moment his face took the &ldquo;pale cast of thought,&rdquo;
and he remained silent for several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; he said at length, speaking
slowly and rather sadly. &ldquo;You mean that I am Quipai, and that
without me Quipai would be nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;. Quipai is a
miracle; you are its creator, yet I doubt whether, as it now
exists, it could long survive you. But that is a contingency which
we need not discuss; you have still many years of life before
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like a well-turned compliment, Monsieur Nigel, because
in order to be acceptable it must possess both a modicum of truth
and a <em>soup&ccedil;on</em> of wit. But flattery I detest, for it
must needs be insincere. A man of ninety cannot, in the nature of
things, have many years of life before him. What are even ten years
to one who has already lived nearly a century? This is a solemn
moment for both of us, and I want to be sincere with you. You were
sincere just now when you said Quipai would perish with me. And it
will&mdash;unless I can find a successor who will continue the work
which I have begun. My people are good and faithful, but they
require a prescient and capable chief, and there is not one among
them who is fitted either by nature or education to take the place
of leader. Will you be my successor, Monsieur Nigel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a startling proposal. To stay in Quipai for a few weeks
or even a few months might be very delightful. But to settle for
life in an Andean desert! On the other hand, to leave Quipai were
to lose Angela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hesitate. But reflect well, my friend, before denying
my request. True, you are loath to renounce the great world with
its excitements, ambitions, and pleasures. But you would renounce
them for a life free from care, an honorable position, and a career
full of promise. It will take years to complete the work I have
begun, and make Quipai a nation. As I said when you first came,
Providence sent you here, as it sent Angela, for some good end. It
sent the one for the other. Stay with us, Monsieur Nigel, and marry
Angela! If you search the world through you could find no sweeter
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hesitation vanished like the morning mist before the rising
sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Angela will be my wife,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will
be your successor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the answer I expected, Monsieur Nigel. I am content
to let Angela be the arbiter of your fate and the fate of Quipai.
She will be here presently. Put the question yourself. She knows
nothing of this; but I have watched you both, and though my eyes
are growing dim I am not blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the abb&eacute; left me to my thoughts. It was not
the first time that the idea of asking Angela to be my wife had
entered my mind. I loved her from the moment I first set eyes on
her, and my love has become a passion. But I had not been able to
see my way. How could I ask a beautiful, gently nurtured girl to
share the lot of a penniless wanderer, even if she could consent to
leave Quipai, which I greatly doubted. But now! Compared with
Angela, the excitements and ambitions of which the abb&eacute; had
spoken did not weigh as a feather in the balance. Without her life
would be a dreary penance; with her a much worse place than Quipai
would be an earthly paradise.</p>
<p>But would she have me? The abb&eacute; seemed to think so.
Nevertheless, I felt by no means sure about it. True, she appeared
to like my company. But that might be because I had so much to tell
her that was strange and new; and though I had observed her
narrowly, I had detected none of that charming self-consciousness,
that tender confusion, those stolen glances, whereby the
conventional lover gauges his mistress&rsquo;s feelings, and knows
before he speaks that his love is returned. Angela was always the
same&mdash;frank, open, and joyous, and, except that her caresses
were reserved for him, made no difference between the abb&eacute;
and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <em>chirimoya</em> for your thoughts,
se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; said a well-known voice, in musical Castilian.
&ldquo;For these three minutes I have been standing close by you,
with this freshly gathered chirimoya, and you took no notice of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons and a thousand thanks,
se&ntilde;orita!&rdquo; I answered, taking the proffered fruit.
&ldquo;But my thoughts were worth all the chirimoyas in the world,
delicious as they are, for they were of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were thinking of each other then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Were you thinking of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Si, se&ntilde;or.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what were you thinking, se&ntilde;orita?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That God was very good in sending you to
Quipai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For several reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you have done the abb&eacute; good. Aforetime he
was often sad. You remember his saying that he had cares. I know
not what, but now he seems himself again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Si, se&ntilde;or.</em> You have also increased my
happiness. Not that I was unhappy before, for, thanks to the dear
abb&eacute;, my life has been free from sorrow; but during the last
month&mdash;since you came&mdash;I have been more than happy, I
have been joyous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me to go, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O se&ntilde;or! Want you to go! How can you&mdash;what
have I done or said?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, impetuously and
almost indignantly. &ldquo;Surely, sir, you are not tired of us
already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid! If you want me to stay I shall not go. It
is for you to decide. <em>Angela mia</em>, it depends on you
whether I go away soon&mdash;how or whither I know not&mdash;or
stay here all my life long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends on me! Then, sir, I bid you stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Angela, you must say more than that. You must consent
to become my wife; then do with me what you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife! You ask me to become your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Angela. I have loved you since the day we first met;
every day my love grows stronger and deeper, and unless you love me
in return, and will be my wife, I cannot stay; I must go&mdash;go
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Quipai, se&ntilde;or</em>,&rdquo; said Angela,
archly, at the same time giving me her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quipai! I don&rsquo;t quite understand&mdash;unless you
mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quipai,&rdquo; she repeated, her eyes brightening into a
merry smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quipai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how dull I am! I see now. Quipai&mdash;rest
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Si, se&ntilde;or.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I rest here, you will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you wish, se&ntilde;or, and with all my heart; for
as you love me, so I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Angela!&rdquo; I said, kissing her hand,
&ldquo;you make me almost too happy. Never will I leave Quipai
without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And never will I leave it without you. But let us not
talk of leaving Quipai. Where can we be happier than here with the
dear abb&eacute;? But what will he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will give us his blessing. His most ardent wish is
that I should be your husband and his successor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good he is? And I, wicked girl that I am, repay his
goodness with base ingratitude. Ah me! How shall I tell
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You repay his goodness with base ingratitude? You speak
in riddles, my Angela.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the waves washed me to his feet, a little child,
the abb&eacute; has cherished me with all the tenderness of a
mother, all the devotion of a father. He has been everything to me;
and now you are everything to me. I love you better than I love
him. Don&rsquo;t you think I am a wicked girl?&rdquo; And she put
her arm within mine, and looking at me with love-beaming eyes,
caressing my cheek with her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will grant you absolution, and award you no worse
penance than an embrace, <em>ma fille cherie</em>,&rdquo; said the
abb&eacute;, who had returned to the veranda just in time to
overhear Angela&rsquo;s confession. &ldquo;I rejoice in your
happiness, <em>mignonne</em>. To-day you make two men
happy&mdash;your lover and myself. You have lightened my mind of
the cares which threatened to darken my closing days. The thought
of leaving you without a protector and Quipai without a chief was a
sore trouble. Your husband will be both. Like Moses, I have seen
the Promised Land, and I shall be content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk not of dying, dear father or you will make me
sad,&rdquo; said Angela, putting her arms round his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are worse things than dying, my child. But you are
quite right; this is no time for melancholy forebodings. Let us be
happy while we may; and since I came to Quipai, sixty years ago, I
have had no happier day than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the only law at Quipai was the abb&eacute;&rsquo;s will, and
we had neither settlements to make, trousseaux to prepare, nor
house to get ready (the abb&eacute;&rsquo;s house being big enough
for us all), there was no reason why our wedding should be delayed,
and the week after Angela and I had plighted our troth, we were
married at the church of San Cristobal.</p>
<p>The abb&eacute;&rsquo;s wedding-present to Angela was a gold
cross studded with large uncut diamonds. Where he got them I had no
idea, but I heard afterward&mdash;and something more.</p>
<p>All this time nothing, save vague generalities, had passed
between us on the subject of religion&mdash;rather to my surprise,
for priests are not wont to ignore so completely their <em>raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</em>, but I subsequently found that Balthazar,
albeit a devout Christian, was no bigot. Either his early training,
his long isolation from ecclesiastical influence, or his communings
with Nature had broadened his horizon and spiritualized his
beliefs. Dogma sat lightly on him, and he construed the apostolic
exhortations to charity in their widest sense. But these views were
reserved for Angela and myself. With his flock he was the Roman
ecclesiastic&mdash;a sovereign pontiff&mdash;whom they must obey in
this world on pain of being damned in the next. For he held that
the only ways of successfully ruling semi-civilized races are by
physical force, personal influence, or their fear of the unseen and
the unknown. At the outset Balthazar, having no physical force at
his command, had to trust altogether to personal influence, which,
being now re-enforced by the highest religious sanctions, made his
power literally absolute. Albeit Quipai possessed neither soldiers,
constables, nor prison, his authority was never questioned; he was
as implicitly obeyed as a general at the head of an army in the
field.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the abb&eacute;&rsquo;s communings with Nature.
I ought rather to have said his searchings into her mysteries; for
he was a shrewd philosopher and keen observer, and despite the
disadvantages under which he labored, the scarcity of his books,
and the rudeness of his instruments, he had acquired during his
long life a vast fund of curious knowledge which he placed
unreservedly at my disposal. I became his pupil, and it was he who
first kindled in my breast that love of science which for nearly
three-score years I have lived only to gratify.</p>

<h2>The Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s Legacy.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Life was easy at Quipai, and we were free from care. On the
other hand, we had so much to do that time sped swiftly, and though
we were sometimes tired we were never weary. The abb&eacute; made
me the civil governor of the mission, and gave orders that I should
be as implicitly obeyed as himself. My duties in this capacity,
though not arduous, were interesting, including as they did all
that concerned the well-being of the people, the maintenance of the
<em>azequia</em>, and the irrigation of the oasis. My leisure hours
were spent in study, working in the abb&eacute;&rsquo;s laboratory,
and with Angela, who nearly always accompanied me on my excursions
to the head of the aqueduct which, as I have already mentioned was
at the foot of the snow-line, two days&rsquo; journey from the
valley lake.</p>
<p>It was during one of these excursions that we planned our new
home, a mountain nest which we would have all to ourselves, and
whither at the height of summer we might escape from the heat of
the oasis, for albeit the climate of Quipai was fine on the whole,
there were times when the temperature rose to an uncomfortable
height. The spot on which we fixed was a hollow in the hills, some
two miles beyond the crater reservoir and about eight thousand feet
above the level of the sea. By tapping the <em>azequia</em> we
turned the barren valley into a garden of roses, for in that
rainless region water was a veritable magician, whatsoever it
touched it vivified. This done we sent up timber, and built
ourselves a cottage, which we called Alta Vista, for the air was
superb and the view one of the grandest in the world.</p>
<p>Angela would fain have persuaded the abb&eacute; to join us; yet
though I made a well-graded road and the journey was neither long
nor fatiguing he came but seldom. He was so thoroughly acclimatized
that he preferred the warmth of San Cristobal to the freshness of
Alta Vista, and the growing burden of his years indisposed him to
exertion, and made movement an effort. We could all see, and none
more clearly than himself, that the end was not far off. He
contemplated it with the fortitude of a philosopher and the faith
of a Christian. For the spiritual wants of his people he provided
by ordaining (as in virtue of his ecclesiastical rank he had the
right to do), three young men, whom he had carefully educated for
the purpose; the reins of government he gave over entirely to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lived a long life and done a good work, and though
I shall be sorry to leave you, I am quite content to go,&rdquo; he
said one day to Angela and me. &ldquo;It is not in my power to
bequeath you a fortune, in the ordinary sense of the word, for
money I have none, yet so long as the mission prospers you will be
better off than if I could give you millions. But everything human
is ephemeral and I cannot disguise from myself the possibility of
some great disaster befalling you. Those mountains contain both
gold and silver, and an invasion of treasure-seekers, either from
the sea or the Cordillera would be the ruin of the mission. My poor
people would be demoralized, perhaps destroyed, and you would be
compelled to quit Quipai and return to the world. For that
contingency, though I hope it will never come to pass, you must be
prepared, and I will point out the way. The mountains, as I have
said, contain silver and gold; and contain something even more
precious than silver and gold&mdash;diamonds, I made the discovery
nearly half a century ago, and I confess that, for a time, the
temptation was almost more than I could withstand. With such wealth
as I saw at my disposal I might do anything, be anything, enrich my
order, win distinction for myself, and attain to high rank, perhaps
the highest, in the church, or leave it and become a power in the
world, a master of men and the guest of princes. Yes, it was a sore
temptation, but with God&rsquo;s help, I overcame it and chose the
better part, the path of duty, and I have my reward. I brought a
few diamonds away with me, some of which are in Angela&rsquo;s
cross; but I have never been to the place since. I told you not
this sooner, my son, partly because there seemed no need, partly
because, not knowing you as well as I know you now, I thought you
might be tempted in like manner as I was and we pray not to be led
into temptation. But though I tell you where these precious stones
are to be found, I am sure that you will never quit
Quipai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no great desire to know the whereabout of this
diamond mine, father. Tell me or not as you think fit. In any case,
I shall be true to my trust and my word. I promise you that I will
not leave Quipai till I am forced, and I hope I never may
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, my son, it is the part of a wise man to
provide for even unlikely contingencies. Remember, it is the
unexpected that happens, and I would not have you and our dear
Angela cast on the world penniless. For her, bred as she has been,
it would be a frightful misfortune; and up yonder are diamonds
which would make you rich beyond the dreams of avarice. Promise me
that you will go thither, and bring away as many as you can
conveniently carry about your persons in the event of your being
compelled to quit the oasis at short notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise. Nevertheless, I see no
probability&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are discussing possibilities not probabilities, my
son. And during the last few days I have had forebodings, if I were
superstitious I should say prophetic visions, else had I not
broached the subject. Regard it, if you like, as an old man&rsquo;s
whim&mdash;and keep a look-out on the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why particularly on the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the quarter whence danger is most to be
apprehended. If some Spanish war-ship were to sight the oasis and
send a boat ashore, either out of idle curiosity or for other
reasons, a report would be made to the captain-general, or to
whomsoever is now in authority at Lima, and there would come a
horde of government functionaries, who would take possession of
everything, and you would have to go. But take your pen and note
down the particulars that will enable you to find the diamond
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Angela and I listened to the abb&eacute;&rsquo;s warnings
with all respect, they made little impression on our minds. We
regarded them as the vagaries of an old man, whose mind was
affected by the feebleness of his body, and a few weeks later he
breathed his last. His death came in the natural order of things,
and, as he had outlived his strength, it was for him a happy
release; yet, as we had loved him much, we sorrowed for him deeply,
and I still honor his memory. Take him all in all, Abb&eacute;
Balthazar was the best man I have ever known.</p>
<p>Shortly after we laid him in the ground I made a visit to the
diamond ground, the situation of which the abb&eacute; had so fully
described that I found it without difficulty. But the undertaking,
besides proving much more arduous than I had anticipated, came near
to costing me my life. I took with me an <em>arriero</em> and three
mules, one carrying an ample supply of food, and, as I thought, of
water, for the abb&eacute; had told me that a mountain-stream ran
through the valley where I was to look for the diamonds. As
ill-luck would have it, however, the stream was dried up. Had it
not been that I did not like to return empty-handed I should have
returned at once, for our stock of water was exhausted and we were
two days&rsquo; journey from Quipai.</p>
<p>I spent a whole day seeking among the stones and pebbles, and my
search was so far successful that I picked up two score diamonds,
some of considerable size. If I could have stayed longer I might
have made a still richer harvest; and I had an idea that there were
more under than above ground. But I had stayed too long as it was.
The mules were already suffering for want of water; all three
perished before we reached Quipai, and the arriero and myself got
home only just alive.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, had not Angelo put her veto on the project, I
should have made another visit to the place, provided with a
sufficiency of water for the double journey. I, moreover, thought
that with time and proper tools I could find water on the spot.
However, I went not again, and I renounced my design all the more
willingly as I knew that the diamonds I had already found were a
fortune in themselves. I added them to my collection of minerals
which I kept in my cabinet at Alta Vista. My Quipais being honest
and knowing nothing whatever of precious stones I had no fear of
robbers.</p>
<p>For several years after Balthazar&rsquo;s death nothing occurred
to disturb the even tenor of our way, and I had almost forgotten
his warnings, and that we were potentially &ldquo;rich beyond the
dreams of avarice,&rdquo; when one day a runner brought word that
two men had landed on the coasts and were on the way to San
Cristobal.</p>
<p>This was startling news, and I questioned the messenger closely,
but all he could tell me was that the strangers had arrived in a
small boat, half famished and terribly thirsty, and had asked, in
broken Spanish, to be taken to the chief of the country, and that
he had been sent on to inform me of their coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The abb&eacute;!&rdquo; exclaimed Angela, &ldquo;you
remember what he said about danger from the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but there is nothing to fear from two hungry men in
a small boat&mdash;as I judge from the runner&rsquo;s account,
shipwrecked mariners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; there&rsquo;s no telling, they may be
followed by others, and unless we keep them here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If necessary we must keep them here; as, however, they
are evidently not Spaniards it may not be necessary. But as to that
I can form no opinion till I have seen and questioned
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were still talking about them, for the incident was both
suggestive and exciting, when the strangers were brought in. As I
expected, they were seamen, in appearance regular old salts. One
was middle-sized, broad built, brawny, and large-limbed&mdash;a
squat Hercules, with big red whiskers, earrings and a pig-tail. His
companion was taller and less sturdy, his black locks hung in
ringlets on either side of a swarthy, hairless face, and the arms
and hands of both, as also their breasts were extensively
tattooed.</p>
<p>Their surprise on beholding Angela and me was almost ludicrous.
They might have been expecting to see a copper-colored cacique
dressed in war-paint and adorned with scalps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White! By the piper that played before Moses,
white!&rdquo; muttered the red-whiskered man. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d
ha&rsquo; thought it! A squaw in petticoats, too, with a gold chain
round her neck! Where the hangmant have we got to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are English?&rdquo; I said, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;yes, sir! I&rsquo;m English,
name of Yawl, Bill Yawl, sir, of the port of Liverpool, at your
service. My mate, here, he&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell my own tale, if you please, Bill
Yawl,&rdquo; interrupted the other as I thought rather
peremptorily. &ldquo;My name is Kidd, and I&rsquo;m a native of
Barbadoes in the West Indies, by calling, a mariner, and late
second mate of the brig Sulky Sail, Jones, master, bound from
Liverpool to Lima, with a cargo of hardware and cotton
goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what has become of the Sulky Sail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went to the bottom, sir, three days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there has been no bad weather, lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not lately. But we made very bad weather rounding the
Horn, and the ship sprang a leak, and though, by throwing cargo
overboard, and working hard at the pumps, we managed to keep her
afloat nearly a month; she foundered at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you the only survivors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; the master and most of the crew got away in the
long boat. But as the ship went down the dinghy was swamped. Bill
and me managed to right her and get aboard again, but the others as
was with us got drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the long boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lost each other in the night, and, having no water,
and only a tin of biscuits, Bill and me made straight for the
coast, and landed in the little cove down below this morning. All
we have is what we stand up in. And we shall feel much obliged if
you will kindly give us food and shelter until such time as we can
get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this I assured Mr. Kidd that I was sorry for their
misfortune, and would gladly find them food and lodging, and
whatever else they might require, but as for getting away, I did
not see how that was possible, unless by sea, and in their own
dinghy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very grateful for your kindness, sir; but I
don&rsquo;t think we should much like to make another voyage in the
dinghy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t seaworthy,&rdquo; growled Yawl,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve to bale all the time, and if it came on to blow
she&rsquo;d turn turtle in half a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be some vessel will be touching here, sir,&rdquo;
suggested Kidd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vessels never do touch here, except to be dashed in
pieces against the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we shall have to wait till a chance
happens out. This seems a nice place, and we are in no hurry, if
you aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two castaways became my guests; and if they waited to be
taken off by a passing ship they were likely to remain my guests as
long as they lived.</p>
<p>For a few days they rambled about the place with their hands in
their pockets and cigars (with which I supplied them liberally) in
their mouths. But after a while time began to hang heavy on their
hands, and one day they came to me with a proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are tired of doing nothing, Mr. Fortescue,&rdquo; said
Kidd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the hardest work I ever put my hand to, and not a
grog-shop in the place,&rdquo; interposed Yawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your jaw, Bill, and let me say my say out. We are
tired of doing nothing, and if you like we will build you a
sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sloop! To go away in, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is as you please, sir. Anyhow, a sloop, say of
fifteen or twenty tons, would be very useful. You might take a sail
with your lady now and again, and explore the coast. Yawl has been
both ship&rsquo;s carpenter and bo&rsquo;son&mdash;he&rsquo;ll boss
the job; and I&rsquo;m a very fair amateur cabinet-maker. If you
want anything in that line doing at your house, sir, I shall be
glad to do it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The project pleased me; an occasional cruise would be an
agreeable diversion, and I assented to Kidd&rsquo;s proposal
without hesitation. There was as much wreckage lying on the cliff
as would build a man-of-war, and a small cove at the foot of the
oasis where the sloop could lie safely at anchor.</p>
<p>So the work was taken in hand, some of my own people helping,
and after several months&rsquo; labor the Angela, as I proposed to
call her, was launched. She had a comfortable little cabin and so
soon as she was masted and rigged would be ready for sea.</p>
<p>In the mean time I asked Kidd to superintend some alterations I
was making at Alta Vista, and among other things construct larger
cabinets for my mineral and entomological specimens. He did the
work quite to my satisfaction, but before it was well finished I
made a portentous discovery&mdash;several of my diamonds were
missing. There could be no doubt about it, for I knew the number to
a nicety, and had counted them over and over again. Neither could
there be any doubt that Kidd was the thief. Besides my wife,
myself, and one or two of our servants, no one else had been in the
room; and our own people would not have taken the trouble to pick
up a diamond from the ground, much less steal one from my
house.</p>
<p>My first impulse was to accuse Kidd of the theft and have him
searched. And then I reflected that I was almost as much to blame
as himself. Assuming that he knew something of the value of
precious stones, I had exposed him to temptation by leaving so many
and of so great value in an open drawer. He might well suppose that
I set no store by them, and that half a dozen or so would never be
missed. So I decided to keep silence for the present and keep a
watch on Mr. Kidd&rsquo;s movements. It might be that he and Yawl
were thinking to steal a march on me and sail away secretly with
the sloop, and perhaps something else. They had both struck up
rather close friendships with native women.</p>
<p>But as I did not want to lose any more of my diamonds, and there
was no place at Alta Vista where they would be safe so long as Kidd
was on the premises, I put them in a bag in the inside pocket of a
quilted vest which I always wore on my mountain excursions, my
intention being to take them on the following day down to San
Cristobal and bestow them in a secure hiding-place.</p>
<p>I little knew that I should never see San Cristobal again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XXX" id="Ch_XXX">Chapter XXX.</a></h3>
<h2>The Quenching of Quipai.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The cottage at Alta Vista had expanded little by little into a
long, single storied flat-roofed house, shaded by palm-trees and
set in a fair garden, which looked all the brighter from its
contrast with the brown and herbless hill-sides that uprose around
it.</p>
<p>In the after part of the day on which I discovered the theft,
Angela and myself were sitting under the veranda, which fronted the
house and commanded a view of the great reservoir, the oasis and
the ocean. She was reading aloud a favorite chapter in &ldquo;Don
Quixote,&rdquo; one of the few books we possessed. I was
smoking.</p>
<p>Angela read well; her pronunciation of Spanish was faultless,
and I always took particular pleasure in hearing her read the
idiomatic Castilian of Cervantes. Nevertheless, my mind wandered;
and, try as I might, I could not help thinking more of the theft of
the diamonds than the doughty deeds of the Don and the shrewd
sayings of Sancho Panza. Not that the loss gave me serious concern.
A few stones more or less made no great difference, and I should
probably never turn to account those I had. But the incident
revived suspicions as to the good faith of the two castaways, which
had been long floating vaguely in my mind. From the first I had
rather doubted the account they gave of themselves. And Kidd! I had
never much liked him; he had a hard inscrutable face, and unless I
greatly misjudged him was capable of bolder enterprises than petty
larceny. He was just the man to steal secretly away and return with
a horde of unscrupulous treasure-seekers, for he knew now that
there were diamonds in the neighborhood, and he must have heard
that we had found gold and silver ornaments and vessels in the old
cemetery&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Dios mio!</em> What is that?&rdquo; exclaimed Angela,
dropping her book and springing to her feet, an example which I
instantly followed, for the earth was moving under us, and there
fell on our ears, for the first time, the dread sound of
subterranean thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An earthquake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the alarm was only momentary. In less time than it takes to
tell the trembling ceased and the thunder died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a slight shock, after all,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
I hope we shall have no more. However, it is just as well to be
prepared. I will have the mules got out of the stable; and if there
is anything inside you particularly want you had better fetch it. I
will join you in the garden presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I passed through the house I saw Kidd coming out of the room
where I kept my specimens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; I asked him,
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went for a tool I left there&rdquo; (holding up a
chisel). &ldquo;Did you feel the shock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there may be another. Tell Maximiliano to get
the mules out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has been after the diamonds,&rdquo; I thought,
&ldquo;he must know that I have taken them away. I had better make
sure of them.&rdquo; And with that I stepped into my room, put on
my quilted jacket, and armed myself with a small hatchet and a
broad-bladed, highly tempered knife, given to me by the
abb&eacute;, which served both as a dagger and a
<em>machete</em>.</p>
<p>When I had seen the mules safely tethered, and warned the
servants and others to run into the open if there should be another
shock, I returned to Angela, who had resumed her seat in the
veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Equipped for the mountains! Where away now, <em>caro
mio</em>?&rdquo; she said, regarding me with some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere. At any rate, I have no present intention of
running away. I have put on my jacket because of these diamonds,
and brought my hatchet and hunting-knife because, if the house
collapses, I should not be able to get them at the very time they
would be the most required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the house collapses! You think, then, we are going to
have a bad earthquake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible. This is an earthquake country; there has
been nothing more serious than a slight trembling since long before
the abb&eacute; died; and I have a feeling that something more
serious is about to happen. Underground thunder is always an
ominous symptom.&mdash;Ah! There it is again. Run into the garden.
I will bring the chairs and wraps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house being timber built and one storied, I had little fear
that it would collapse; but anything may happen in an earthquake,
and in the garden we were safe from anything short of the ground on
which we stood actually gaping or slipping bodily down the
mountain-side.</p>
<p>The second shock was followed by a third, more violent than
either of its predecessors. The earth trembled and heaved so that
we could scarcely stand. The underground thunder became louder and
continuous and, what was even more appalling, we could distinctly
see the mountain-tops move and shake, as if they were going to fall
and overwhelm us.</p>
<p>But even this shock passed off without doing any material
mischief, and I was beginning to think the worst was over when one
of the servants drew my attention to the great reservoir. It smoked
and though there was no wind the water was white with foam and
running over the banks.</p>
<p>This went on several minutes, and then the water, as if yielding
to some irresistible force, left the sides, and there shot out of
it a gigantic jet nearly as thick as the crater was wide and
hundreds of feet high. It broke in the form of a rose and fell in a
fine spray, which the setting sun hued with all the colors of the
rainbow.</p>
<p>It was the most splendid sight I had ever seen and the most
portentous&mdash;for I knew that the crater had become active, and
remembering how long it had taken to fill I feared the worst.</p>
<p>The jet went on rising and falling for nearly an hour, but as
the mass of the water returned to the crater, very little going
over the sides, no great harm was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven for the respite!&rdquo; exclaimed Angela,
who had been clinging to me all the time, trembling yet courageous.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the danger is now past, my
Nigel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us, it may be. But if the crater has really become
active. I fear that our poor people at San Cristobal will be in
very great danger indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! God alone&mdash;Hearken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A muffled peal of thunder which seemed to come from the very
bowels of the earth, followed by a detonation like the discharge of
an army&rsquo;s artillery, and the sides of the crater opened, and
with a wild roar the pent-up torrent burst forth, and leaping into
the lake, rolled, a mighty avalanche of water, toward the doomed
oasis.</p>
<p>We looked at each other in speechless dismay. Nothing could
resist that terrible flood; it would sweep everything before it,
for, though its violence might be lessened before it reached the
sea, only the few who happened to be near the coast could escape
destruction.</p>
<p>Nobody spoke; the roar of the cataract deafened us, the
awfulness of the catastrophe made us dumb. We were as if stunned,
and I was conscious of nothing save a sickening sense of
helplessness and despair.</p>
<p>For an hour we stood watching the outpouring of the water. In
that hour Quipai was destroyed and its people perished.</p>
<p>As the blood-red sun sank into the bosom of the broad Pacific, a
great cloud of smoke and steam, mingled with stones and ashes, was
puffed out of the crater and a stream of fiery lava, bursting from
the breach in the side of the mountain, followed in the wake of the
water.</p>
<p>The uproar was terrific; explosion succeeded explosion; great
stones hurled through the air and fell back into the crater with a
din like discharges of musketry, and whenever there came a lull we
could hear the hissing of the water as it met the lava.</p>
<p>We remained in the garden the night through. Nobody thought of
going indoors; but after a while we became so weary with watching
and overwrought with excitement that, despite the danger and the
noise we could not keep our eyes open. Before the southern cross
began to bend we were all asleep, Angela and I wrapped in our
cobijas, the others on the turf and under the trees.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes the sun was rising majestically above the
Cordillera, but its rays had not yet reached the ocean. I rose and
looked around. The crater was still smoking, and a mist hung over
the oasis, but the lava had ceased to flow, and not a zephyr moved
the air, not a tremor stirred the earth. Only the blackened throat
of the volcano and the ghastly rent in its side were there to
remind us of the havoc that had been wrought and the ruin of
Quipai.</p>
<p>I roused the people and bade them prepare breakfast, for though
thousands may perish in a night, the survivors must eat on the
morrow. The house, albeit considerably shaken, was still intact,
but several of the doors were so tightly jammed that I had to break
them open with my hatchet.</p>
<p>When breakfast was ready I woke Angela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it real, or have I been dreaming?&rdquo; she asked,
with a shudder, looking wildly round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only too real,&rdquo; I said, pointing to the
smoking crater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Misericordia!</em> what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, we must go down to the oasis and see
whether any of the people are left alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. When we have done what we can for the
others it will be time enough to think about ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any others?&rdquo; I thought, for I greatly
doubted whether we should find any alive, except, perhaps, Yawl and
the three or four men who were helping him. But I kept my
misgivings to myself, and after breakfast we set off. Angela and
myself were mounted, and I assigned a mule to Kidd. The man might
be useful, and, circumstanced as we were, it would have been bad
policy to give him the cold shoulder. We also took with us
provisions, clothing, and a tent, for I was by no means sure that
we should find either food or shelter on the oasis.</p>
<p>As we passed the volcano I looked into the crater. Nearly level
with the breach made by the water was a great mass of seething
lava, which I regarded as a sure sign that another eruption might
take place at any moment. The valley lake had disappeared; banks,
trees, soil, dwellings, all were gone, leaving only bare rocks and
burning lava. Of San Cristobal there was not a vestige; the oasis
had been converted into a damp and steaming gully, void of
vegetation and animal life. But, as I had anticipated, the force of
the flood was spent before it reached the coast. Much of the water
had overflowed into the desert and been absorbed by the sand, and
the little that remained was now sinking into the earth and being
evaporated by the sun.</p>
<p>For hours Angela and I rode on in silence; our distress was too
deep for words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quipai is gone,&rdquo; she murmured at length, shuddering
and looking at me with tear-filled eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, gone and forever. As entirely as if it had never
been. It is worse than the carnage of a great battle. These poor
people! Nature is more cruel than man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely! will you not try to restore the oasis and
re-create Quipai?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do that, <em>cara mia</em>, would require another
Abb&eacute; Balthazar and sixty years of life. And to what end?
Sooner or later our work would be destroyed as his has been, even
if we were allowed to begin it. The volcano may be active for ages.
We must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the world, that in new scenes and occupation we
may perchance forget this crowning calamity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is something to have been happy so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is much; it is almost everything. Whatever the future
may have in store for us, darling, nothing can deprive us of the
sunny memories of the past, and the happiness we have enjoyed at
Quipai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, and if this misfortune were not so
terrible&mdash;But God knows best. It ill becomes me, who never
knew sorrow before, to repine.&mdash;Yes, let us go. But
how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By sea. I fear you would never survive the hazards and
hardships of a journey over the Cordillera, and dearly as I love
you&mdash;because I love you&mdash;I would rather have you die than
be captured by Indians and made the wife of some savage cacique.
Yes, we must go by sea, in the sloop built by these two castaways.
Yet, even in that there will be a serious risk; for if they suspect
I have the diamonds in my possession&mdash;and I am afraid the
suspicion is inevitable&mdash;they will probably&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to murder us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder us! For the diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Angela, for the diamonds. In the world which you
have never seen men commit horrible crimes for insignificant gains,
and I have here in my pocket the value of a king&rsquo;s ransom.
Even the average man could hardly withstand so great a temptation,
and all we know of these sailors is that one of them is a
thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, I must find a safer hiding-place for our
wealth than my pockets; and we must be ever on our guard. The
voyage will not be long, and we shall be three against
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three! You will take Ramon, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;if he will go with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he will. Ramon would follow you to the
world&rsquo;s end. And the other sailor&mdash;Yawl&mdash;may have
been drowned in the flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. The flood did not go much farther
than this, and Yawl was busy with his boat. But we shall soon know;
the cliffs are in sight.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>North by West.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Besides Yawl and his helpers, we found on the beach about thirty
men and women, the saved of two thousand. Among them was one of the
priests ordained by the abb&eacute;. All had lived in the lower
part of the oasis, and when the volcano began spouting water, after
the third earthquake, they fled to the coast and so escaped. Though
naturally much distressed (being bereft of home, kindred, and all
they possessed), they bore their misfortunes with the uncomplaining
stoicism so characteristic of their race.</p>
<p>The immediate question was how to dispose of these unfortunates.
I could not take them away in the sloop, and I knew that they would
prefer to remain in the neighborhood where they were born. But the
oasis was uninhabitable. A few weeks and it would be merged once
more in the desert from which it had been so painfully won.
Therefore I proposed that they should settle at Alta Vista under
charge of the priest. Alta Vista being above the volcano no
outburst of lava could reach them, and the <em>azequia</em> being
intact beyond that point they could easily bring more land under
cultivation and live in comfort and abundance.</p>
<p>To this proposal the survivors and the priest gladly and
gratefully assented. They were very good, those poor Indians, and
seemed much more concerned over our approaching departure than
their own fate, beseeching us, with many entreaties, not to leave
them. Angela would have yielded, but I was obdurate. I could not
see that it was in any sense our duty to bury ourselves in a remote
corner of the Andes for the sake of a score or two of Indians who
were very well able to do without us. What could be the good of
building up another colony and creating another oasis merely that
the evil genii of the mountains might destroy them in a night? Had
the abb&eacute;, instead of spending a lifetime in making Quipai,
devoted his energies to some other work, he might have won for
himself enduring fame and permanently benefited mankind. As it was,
he had effected less than nothing, and I was resolved not to court
his fate by following his example.</p>
<p>Those were the arguments I used to Angela, and in the end she
not only fully agreed with me that it was well for us to go, but
that the sooner we went the better. The means were at hand. Yawl
could have the yacht ready for sea within twenty-four hours. There
was little more to do than head the sails and get water and
provisions on board. I had the casks filled forthwith&mdash;for the
water in the channels was fast draining away&mdash;set some of the
people to work preparing <em>tasajo</em>, and sent Ramon with the
mules and two <em>arrieros</em> to Alta Vista for the remainder of
our clothing, bedding, and several other things which I thought
would be useful on the voyage.</p>
<p>Ramon, I may mention, was my own personal attendant. He had been
brought up and educated by Angela and myself, and was warmly
attached to us. In disposition he was bright and courageous, in
features almost European; there could be little doubt that he was
descended from some white castaway, who had landed on the coast and
been adopted by this tribe. He said it would break his heart if we
left him behind, so we took him with us, and he has ever since been
the faithful companion of my wanderings and my trusty friend.</p>
<p>My wife and I slept in our tent, Kidd and Yawl on the sloop. As
the sails were not bent nor the boat victualled, I had no fear of
their giving us the slip in the night. In the morning Ramon and the
<em>arrieros</em> returned with their lading, and by sunset we had
everything on board and was ready for a start.</p>
<p>The next thing was to settle our course. I wanted to reach a
port where I could turn some of my diamonds into cash and take
shipping for England, the West Indies, or the United States. We
were between Valparaiso and Callao, and the former place, as being
on the way, seemed the more desirable place to make for. But as the
prevailing winds on the coast are north and northwest a voyage in
the opposite direction would involve much beating up and nasty
fetches, and, in all probability, be long and tedious. For these
reasons I decided in favor of Callao, and told Kidd to shape our
course accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you like, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it is all
the same to Yawl and me where we go. But it&rsquo;s a longish
stretch to Callao. Don&rsquo;t you think we had better make for
some nearer place? There&rsquo;s Islay, and there&rsquo;s Arica;
and I doubt whether our water will last out till we get to
Callao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make it last till we get to Callao,&rdquo; I
answered, sharply; &ldquo;except under compulsion I will put in
neither at Islay nor Arica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir! We are under your orders, and what you
say shall be done, as far as lies in our power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kidd&rsquo;s answer was civil but his manner was surly and
defiant, and it struck me that he might have some special reason
for desiring to avoid Callao. But I was resolved to go thither, so
that in case of need I might claim the protection of the British
consul, whom I was sure to find there. I was by no means sure that
I should find one either at Islay or Arica. I knew something of the
ways of Spanish revenue officers, and as I had no papers, it was
quite possible that (in the absence of a consul) I might be cast
into prison and plundered of all I possessed, especially if Mr.
Kidd should hint that it included a bag of diamonds.</p>
<p>The sloop&rsquo;s accommodation for passengers was neither
extensive nor luxurious. The small cabin aft was just big enough to
hold Angela and myself, and once in it, we were like rats in a
hole, as, to get out, we had to climb an almost perpendicular
ladder. Kidd and Yawl were to sleep, turn and turn about, in a sort
of dog-house which they had contrived in the bows. Ramon would roll
himself in his <em>cobija</em> and sleep anywhere.</p>
<p>Before going on board I made such arrangements as I hoped would
insure us against foul play. I stitched one half of the diamonds in
my waist-belt; the other half my wife hid away in her dress. Among
the things brought down from Alta Vista was an exquisite little
dagger with a Damascened blade, which I gave to Angela. I had my
hunting-knife, and Ramon his <em>machete</em>.</p>
<p>I laid it down as a rule from which there was to be no
departure, that Ramon and I were neither to sleep at the same time
nor be in the cabin together, and that when we had anything
particular to say we should say it in Quipai. As it happened, he
knew a little English; I had taught my wife my mother-tongue, and
Ramon, by dint of hearing it spoken, and with a little instruction
from me and from her, had become so far proficient in the language
that he could understand the greater part of what was said. This,
however, was not known to Kidd and Yawl; I told him not to let them
know; but whenever opportunity occurred to listen to their
conversation, and report it to me. I thought that if they meditated
evil against us I might in this way obtain timely information of
their designs; and I considered that, in the circumstances (our
lives being, as I believed, in jeopardy), the expedient was quite
justifiable.</p>
<p>We sailed at sunset and got well away, and the clear sky and
resplendent stars, the calm sea and the fair soft wind augured well
for a prosperous voyage. Yet my heart was sad and my spirits were
low. The parting with our poor Indians had been very trying, and I
could not help asking myself whether I had acted quite rightly in
deserting them, whether it would not have been nobler (though
perhaps not so worldly wise) to throw in my lot with theirs and try
to recreate the oasis, as Angela had suggested. I also doubted
whether I was acting the part of a prudent man in embarking my
wife, my fortune, and myself on a wretched little sloop (which
would probably founder in the first storm), under the control of
two men of whom I knew no good, and who, as I feared, might play us
false?</p>
<p>But whether I had acted wisely or unwisely, there was no going
back now, and as I did not want Angela to perceive that I was
either dubious or downcast, I pulled myself together, put on a
cheerful countenance, and spoke hopefully of our prospects.</p>
<p>She was with us on deck, Kidd being at the helm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no very precise idea how far we maybe from
Callao,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but if this wind lasts we should be
there in five or six days at the outside. Don&rsquo;t you think so,
Kidd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be. You still think of going to Callao,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still think of going to Callao! I am determined to go to
Callao. Why do you ask? Did not I distinctly say so before we
started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had maybe changed your mind. And Callao
won&rsquo;t be easy to make. Neither Yawl nor me has ever been
there; we don&rsquo;t know the bearings, and we have no compass,
and I don&rsquo;t know much about the stars in these
latitudes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do, and better still, I have a compass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A compass! Do you hear that, Bill Yawl? Mr. Fortescue has
got a compass. Go to Callao! Why, we can go a&rsquo;most anywhere.
Where have you got it, sir&mdash;in the cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Abb&eacute; Balthazar and I made it, ever so long
since. It is only rudely fashioned, and has never been adjusted,
but I dare say it will answer the purpose as well as
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it will, and if you&rsquo;ll kindly bring it
here, it&rsquo;ll be a great help. I reckon if I keep her head
about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor&rsquo; by west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir, that&rsquo;s it, I have no doubt. If I keep
her head nor&rsquo; by west, I dare say we shall fetch Callao as
soon as you was a-saying just now. But Bill and me should have the
compass before us when we&rsquo;re steering; and to-morrow
we&rsquo;ll try to rig up a bit of a binnacle. You, perhaps, would
not mind fetching it now, sir?&mdash;Bring that patent lantern of
yours, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fetched the compass and Yawl the lantern, made of a glass
bottle and a piece of copper sheeting (like the rest of our
equipments, the spoil of the sea).</p>
<p>Kidd was quite delighted with the compass, the card of which was
properly marked and framed in a block of wood, and said it could
easily be suspended on gimbals and fixed on a binnacle.</p>
<p>After a while, Angela, who felt tired, went below, and I with
her, but only to fetch my <em>cobija</em> and a pillow, for, as I
told Kidd, I intended to remain on deck all night, the cabin being
too close and stuffy for two persons. This was true, yet not the
whole truth. I had another reason; I saw that nothing would be
easier than for Kidd or Yawl to slip on the cabin-hatch while I was
below, and so have us at their mercy, for Ramon, though a stalwart
youth enough, could not contend with the two sailors
single-handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you like, sir; it&rsquo;s all the same to
me,&rdquo; answered Kidd, rather shortly, and then relapsed into
thoughtful silence.</p>
<p>I felt sure that he was scheming something which boded us no
good, though, as yet, I had no idea what it could be. His motive
for desiring to take the sloop to Islay or Arica, rather than to
Callao, was pretty obvious, but why he should change his mind on
the subject simply because of the compass, passed my comprehension.
We could make Callao merely by running up the coast, with which,
despite his disclaimer, I had not the least doubt he was quite
familiar; and even if he were not, there was nothing in a compass
to enlighten him.</p>
<p>But whatever his scheme might be I did not think he would
attempt to use force&mdash;unless he could take us at a
disadvantage. Man for man, Ramon and I were quite equal to Kidd and
Yawl. We were, moreover, better armed, as so far as I knew, they
had no weapons, save their sailors&rsquo; knives. In a personal
struggle, they might come off second best; were, in any case,
likely to get badly hurt, and unless I was much mistaken, they
wanted to get hold of my diamonds with a minimum of risk to
themselves. Wherefore, so long as we kept a sharp lookout, we had
little to fear from open violence. As for the scheme which was
seething in Kidd&rsquo;s brain, I must needs wait for further
developments before taking measures to counteract it.</p>
<p>When I had come to this conclusion I told Ramon, in Quipai, to
lie down, and that when I wanted to sleep I would waken him.</p>
<p>I watched until midnight, at which hour Yawl relieved Kidd at
the helm, and Kidd turned in. Shortly afterward I roused Ramon, and
bade him keep watch while I slept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XXXII" id="Ch_XXXII">Chapter XXXII.</a></h3>
<h2>Found Out.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>When I awoke it was broad daylight, Yawl at the helm, the sloop
bowling along at a great rate before a fresh breeze. But, to my
utter surprise, there was no land in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this, Yawl?&rdquo; I asked; &ldquo;we are out of
doors. How have you been steering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The course you laid down sir, nor&rsquo; by
west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is impossible. I am not much of a seaman, yet I know
that if you had been steering nor&rsquo; by west, we should have
the coast under our lee, and we cannot even see the peaks of the
Cordillera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you cannot; they are covered with a
mist,&rdquo; put in Kidd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no mist; moreover, the Cordillera is visible a
hundred miles away, and by good rights we should not be more than
thirty or forty miles from the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fault of your compass, then. The darned
thing is all wrong. Better chuck it overboard and have done with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll chuck you overboard. The compass is
quite correct. You have been steering due west for some purpose of
your own, against my orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s your game, is it? You are the skipper,
and us a brace of lubbers as doesn&rsquo;t know north from west, I
suppose. Let him sail the cursed craft hissel, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yawl let go the tiller, on which the sloop broached to and
nearly went on her beam ends. This was more than I could bear, and
calling on Ramon to follow me, I sprang forward, seized Kidd by the
throat, and, drawing my dagger, told him that unless he promised to
obey my orders and do his duty, I would make an end of him then and
there. Meanwhile, Ramon was keeping Yawl off with his
<em>machete</em>, flourishing it around his head in a way that made
the old salt&rsquo;s hair nearly stand on end. Seeing that
resistance was useless, Kidd caved in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask your pardon, Mr. Fortescue,&rdquo; he said,
hoarsely, for my hand was still on his throat. &ldquo;I ask your
pardon, but I lost my temper, and when I lose my temper it&rsquo;s
the very devil; I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing; but I
promise faithfully to obey your orders and do my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this I loosed him, and bade Ramon put up his <em>machete</em>
and let Yawl go back to his steering. In one sense this was an
untoward incident. It made Kidd my personal enemy. Quite apart from
the question of the diamonds, he would bear me a grudge and do me
an ill turn if he could. He was that sort of a man. Henceforward it
would be war to the knife between us, and I should have to be more
on my guard than ever. On the other hand, it was a distinct
advantage to have beaten him in a contest for the mastery; if he
had beaten me, I should have had to accept whatever conditions he
might have thought fit to impose, for I was quite unable to sail
the sloop myself.</p>
<p>A light was thrown on his motive for changing the sloop&rsquo;s
course by something Ramon had told me when the trouble was over.
Shortly before I awoke he heard Kidd say to Yawl that he would very
much like to know where I had hidden the diamonds, and that if they
could only keep her head due west, we should make San Ambrosio
about the same time that I was expecting to make Callao.</p>
<p>I had never heard of San Ambrosio before; but the fact of Kidd
wanting to go thither was reason enough for my not wanting to go,
so I bade Yawl steer due north, that is to say, parallel with the
coast, and as the continent of South America trends considerably to
the westward, about twenty degrees south of the equator, I reckoned
that this course should bring us within sight of land on the
following day, or the day after, according to the speed we
made.</p>
<p>I not only told Yawl and Kidd to steer north, but saw that they
did it, as to which, the compass being now always before us, there
was no difficulty. Thinking it was well to learn to steer, I took a
hand now and again at the tiller, under the direction of Kidd,
whose manners my recent lesson had greatly improved. He was very
affable, and obeyed my orders with alacrity and seeming
good-will.</p>
<p>The next day I began to look out for land, without, however,
much expectation of seeing any, but when a second day, being the
third of our voyage, ended with the same result or, rather, want of
result, I became uneasy, and expressed myself in this sense to
Kidd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have miscalculated the distance,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and there&rsquo;s nothing so easy, when you&rsquo;ve no
chart and can take no observations. And how can you tell the
sloop&rsquo;s rate of sailing? The wind is fair and
constant&mdash;it always is in the trades&mdash;but how do you know
as there is not a strong current dead against us? I don&rsquo;t
think there&rsquo;s the least use looking for land before
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This rather reassured me. It was quite true that the sloop might
not be going so fast as I reckoned, and the coast be farther off
than I thought&mdash;although I did not much believe in the
current.</p>
<p>But the morrow came and went, and still no sign of land, and
again, on the fifth day, the sun rose on an unbroken expanse of
water. In clear weather&mdash;and no weather could be
clearer&mdash;the Andes, as I had heard, were visible to mariners a
hundred and fifty miles out at sea. Yet not a peak could be seen.
Then I knew beyond a doubt that something was wrong. What could it
be? Sailing as swiftly as we had been for five days, it was
inconceivable that we should not have made land if we had been
steering north, and for that I had the evidence of my senses.
Where, then, was the mystery?</p>
<p>As I asked myself this question, Ramon touched me on the
shoulder, and whispered in Quipai:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now Yawl said to Kidd that it was quite time we
sighted San Ambrosio, and that if we missed it, after all, it would
be cursed awkward. And Kidd answered that &lsquo;if we fell in with
Hux it would be all right.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was more puzzling still. He had said before that, if we
continued on the westward tack, we should make San Ambrosio at the
time I was expecting to sight Callao, and now, although we were
sailing due north, the villains counted on making San Ambrosio all
the same.</p>
<p>Where was San Ambrosio? Not on the coast, for they were clearly
looking for it then, had probably been looking for it some time,
and the mainland must be at least two hundred miles away. If not on
the coast San Ambrosio was an island, yet how it could lie both to
the west and to the north was not quite obvious. And who was Hux,
and why should falling in with him make matters all right for my
interesting shipmates? Of one thing I felt sure&mdash;all right for
these meant all wrong for me, and it behooved me to prevent the
meeting&mdash;but how?</p>
<p>While these thoughts were passing through my mind, I was pacing
to and fro on the sloop&rsquo;s deck, where was also Angela,
sitting on a <em>cobija</em>, and leaning against the taffrail,
Kidd being at the helm, and Ramon and Yawl smoking in the bows, for
though they did not quite trust each other, they occasionally
exchanged a not unfriendly word. Now and then I glanced
mechanically at the compass. As I have already mentioned, it was
not an ordinary ship compass in a brass frame, but a makeshift
affair, in a wooden frame, to which Kidd had attached makeshift
gimbals and hung on a makeshift binnacle, the latter being fixed
between the tiller and the cabin-hatch. The deck was very narrow,
and to lengthen my tether I generally passed between the tiller and
the binnacle, sometimes exchanging a word with Angela. Once, as I
did so, the sun&rsquo;s rays fell athwart the sloop&rsquo;s stern,
and, happening the same moment to look at the compass, I made a
discovery that sent the blood with sudden rush first to my heart
and then to my brain; a small piece of iron, invisible in an
ordinary light, had been driven into the framework of the compass,
close to that part of the card marked &ldquo;W,&rdquo; thereby
deflecting the needle to the point in question, so that ever since
our departure from Quipai, we had been steering due west, instead
of north by west, as I intended and believed. The dodge might not
have deceived a seaman, but it had certainly deceived me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You infernal scoundrel, I have found you out. Look
there!&rdquo; I shouted, pointing at the piece of iron. As I spoke
Kidd let go the tiller, and quick as lightning gave me a tremendous
blow with his fist between the shoulders, which just missed
throwing me head foremost down the cabin-hatch, and sent me face
downward on the deck breathless and half stunned. Before I could
even think of rising, Kidd, who, as he struck, shouted to Yawl to
&ldquo;kill the Indian,&rdquo; was kneeling on my back with his
fingers round my windpipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last! I have you now, you conceited jackanapes, you
d&mdash;d sea-lawyer. Where have you got them diamonds? You
won&rsquo;t answer! Shall I throttle you, or brain you with this
belaying-pin? I&rsquo;ll throttle you; then there&rsquo;ll be none
of your dirty blood to swab up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the villain squeezed my windpipe still tighter, and
quite unable either to struggle or speak, I was giving myself up
for lost, when his hold suddenly relaxed, and groaning deeply, he
sank beside me on the deck. Freed from his weight, I staggered to
my feet to find that I owed my life to Angela, who had used her
dagger to such purpose that Kidd was like never to speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramon! Ramon! Haste, or that man will kill him,&rdquo;
she cried, all in a tremble, and pale with horror at the thought of
her own boldness.</p>
<p>Yawl&rsquo;s onslaught was so sudden that the boy had been
unable to draw his <em>machete</em>, and after a desperate bout of
tugging and straining, the sailor had got the upper-hand and was
now kneeling on Ramon&rsquo;s chest, and feeling for his knife.
Though sorely bruised with my fall, and still gasping for breath, I
ran to the rescue, and gripping Yawl by the shoulders, bore him
backward on the deck. Another moment, and we had him at our mercy;
I held down his head, while Ramon, astride on his body, pinioned
his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Yawl!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You have
tried to commit murder and deserve to die; your comrade and
accomplice is dead, but I will spare your life on conditions. You
must promise to obey my orders as if I were your captain, and you
under articles of war, and help me to work the sloop to Callao, or
some other port on the mainland. In return, I promise not to bring
any charge against you when we get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir! Kidd was my master, and I obeyed him; now
you are my master and I will obey you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quite believed that the old salt was speaking sincerely. He
had been so completely under Kidd&rsquo;s influence as to have no
will of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! but there is something else. I must have those
diamonds he stole from my house at Alta Vista. Where are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stitched inside his jersey, under the
arm-hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went to Kidd&rsquo;s body, cut open his jersey, and found the
diamonds in two small canvas bags. They were among the largest I
had and (as I subsequently found) worth fifty thousand pounds.
After we had thrown the body overboard, I ordered Yawl to put the
sloop on the starboard tack, and myself taking the helm changed the
course to due north. Then I asked him who he and Kidd were, whence
they came, and why they had so shamefully deceived me as to the
course we were steering.</p>
<p>On this Yawl answered in a dry, matter-of-fact manner, as if it
were all in the way of business, that Kidd had been captain and he
boatswain and carpenter of a &ldquo;free-trader,&rdquo; known as
the Sky Scraper, Sulky Sail, and by several other aliases; that the
captain and crew fell out over a division of plunder, of which Kidd
wanted the lion&rsquo;s share, the upshot being that he and Yawl,
who had taken sides with him, were shoved into the dinghy and sent
adrift. In these circumstances they naturally made for the nearest
land, which proved to be Quipai, and deeming it inexpedient to
confess that they were pirates, pretended to be castaways. They
built the sloop with the idea of stealing away by themselves, and
but for my discovery of the theft of the diamonds and the bursting
of the crater would have done so. As I suspected, Kidd allowed us
to go with them, solely with a view to cutting our throats and
appropriating the remainder of the diamonds. This design being
frustrated by our watchfulness, he next conceived the notion of
putting in at Arica or Islay, charging me with robbing him, and, in
collusion with the authorities, whom he intended to bribe,
depriving me of all I possessed. This plan likewise failing, and
having a decided objection to Callao, where he was known and where
there might be a British cruiser as well as a British consul, Kidd
hit on the brilliant idea of doctoring the compass and making me
think we were going north by west, while our true course was almost
due west, his object being to reach San Ambrosio, a group of rocky
islets some three hundred miles from the coast, and a pirate
stronghold and trysting-place. If they did not find any old
comrades there, they would at least find provisions, water, and
firearms, and so be able, as they thought, to despoil me of my
diamonds. Also Kidd had hopes of falling in with Captain Hux, a
worthy of the same kidney, who commanded the
&ldquo;free-trader&rdquo; Culebra, and whose favorite
cruising-ground was northward of San Ambrosio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in my opinion,&rdquo; observed Mr. Yawl, coolly, when
he had finished his story, &ldquo;in my opinion we passed south of
the islands last night, and so I told Kidd; they&rsquo;re very
small, and as there&rsquo;s no lights, easy missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be a long way from Callao, then. How far do you
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is more than I can tell; may be four hundred
miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long do you think it will take us to get there,
assuming it to be four hundred miles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, on this tack and with this breeze&mdash;you see,
sir, the wind has fallen off a good deal since sunrise&mdash;with
this breeze, about eight days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight days!&rdquo; I exclaimed, in consternation.
&ldquo;Eight days! and I don&rsquo;t think we have food and water
enough for two. Come with me below, Ramon, and let me see how much
we have left.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Grief and Pain.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>It was even worse than I feared. Reckoning neither on a longer
voyage than five or six days nor on being so far from the coast
that, in case of emergency, we could not obtain fresh supplies, we
had used both provisions and water rather recklessly, and now I
found that of the latter we had no more than, at our recent rate of
consumption, would last eighteen hours, while of food we had as
much as might suffice us for twenty-four. It was necessary to
reduce our allowance forthwith, and I put it to Yawl whether we
could not make for some nearer port than Callao. Better risk the
loss of my diamonds than die of hunger and thirst. Yawl&rsquo;s
answer was unfavorable. The nearest port of the coast as to
distance was the farthest as to time. To reach it, the wind being
north by west, we should have to make long fetches and frequent
tacks, whereas Callao, or the coast thereabout, could be reached by
sailing due north. So there seemed nothing for it but to economize
our resources to the utmost and make all the speed we could. Yet,
do as we might, it was evident that, unless we could obtain a
supply of food and water from some passing ship we should have to
put ourselves on a starvation allowance. I was, however, much less
concerned for myself and the others, than for Angela. Accustomed as
she had been to a gentle, uneventful, happy life, the catastrophe
of Quipai, the anxieties we had lately endured, and the confinement
of the sloop, were telling visibly on her health. Moreover,
Kidd&rsquo;s death, richly as he deserved his fate, had been a
great shock to her. She strove to be cheerful, and displayed
splendid courage, yet the increasing pallor of her cheeks and the
sadness in her eyes, showed how much she suffered. We men stinted
ourselves of water that she might have enough, but seeing this she
declined to take more than her share, often refusing to drink when
she was tormented with thirst.</p>
<p>And then there befell an accident which well-nigh proved fatal
to us all. A gust of wind blew the mainsail (made of grass-cloth)
into ribbons, the consequence being that our rate of sailing was
reduced to two knots an hour, and our hope of reaching Callao to
zero.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Angela grew weaker and weaker, she fell into a low
fever, was at times even delirious, and I began to fear that,
unless help speedily came, a calamity was imminent, which for me
personally would be worse than the quenching of Quipai. And when we
were at the last extremity, mad with thirst and feeble with
fasting, help did come. One morning at daylight Yawl sighted a
sail&mdash;a large vessel a few miles astern of us, but a point or
two more to the west, and on the same tack as ourselves. We altered
the sloop&rsquo;s course at once so as to bring her across the
stranger&rsquo;s bows, for having neither ensign to reverse, nor
gun wherewith to fire a signal of distress, it was a matter of life
and death for us to get within hailing-distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she! Can you make her out?&rdquo; I asked Yawl,
as trembling with excitement, we looked longingly at the noble ship
in which centered our hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three masts! A merchantman? No, I&rsquo;m blest if I
don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s a man-of-war. So she is, a frigate
and a firm &rsquo;un&mdash;forty or fifty guns, I should
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under what flag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute&mdash;Union Jack! No,
stars and stripes. She belongs to Uncle Sam, she do, sir, and
he&rsquo;s no call to be ashamed of her; she&rsquo;s a perfect
beauty and well handled. By&mdash;I do believe they see us. They
are shortening sail. We shall be alongside in a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you and what do you want?&rdquo; asked a voice
from the frigate, so soon as we were within hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are English and starving. For God&rsquo;s sake, throw
us a rope!&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>The rope being thrown and the sloop made fast, I asked the
officer of the watch to take us on board the frigate, as seeing the
condition of our boat and ourselves, I did not think we could
possibly reach our destination, that my wife was very sick, and
unless she could have better attention than we were able to give
her, might not recover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we will take you on board&mdash;and the poor
lady. Pass the word for the doctor, you there! But what on earth
are you doing with a lady in a craft like that, so far out at sea,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer to his question, the officer
ordered a hammock to be lowered, in which we carefully placed
Angela, who was thereupon hoisted on the frigate&rsquo;s deck. We
men followed, and were received by a fine old gentleman with a
florid face and white hair, whom I rightly conjectured to be the
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;what can I do for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water,&rdquo; I gasped, for the exertion of coming on
board had been almost too much for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow! Certainly. Why did I not think of it before?
You shall have both food and drink. Somebody bring water with a
dash of rum in it&mdash;not too much, they are weak. And Mr.
Charles, tell the wardroom steward to get a square meal ready for
this gentleman. Might I ask your name, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigel Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Fortescue. Mine is Bigelow, and I have the
honor to command the United States ship Constellation. Here&rsquo;s
the water! I hope you have not forgotten the dash of rum,
Tomkins.&mdash;There! Take a long drink. You will feel better now,
and when you have had a square meal, you shall tell me all about
it. And the others? You are an old salt, anybody can see
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Bill Yawl at your service, an old
man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s man, able-bodied seaman,
bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n, and ship&rsquo;s carpenter, anything you like
sir. Ax your pardon, sir, but a glass of half-water
grog&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until you have eaten. Then you may have two glasses.
Tomkins, take these men to the purser and tell him to give them a
square meal. The doctor is attending to your wife, Mr. Fortescue.
She is in my state-room and shall have every comfort we can give
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you with all my heart, Captain Bigelow. You are
really too good, I can never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, my dear sir. Pray don&rsquo;t say a word.
I have only given her my spare state-room. Mr. Charles will take
you to the ward-room, we can talk afterward. Meanwhile, I shall
have your belongings got on board, and then, I suppose, we had
better sink that craft of yours. If we leave her to knock about the
ocean she may be knocking against some ship in the night and doing
her a mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After I had eaten the &ldquo;square meal&rdquo; set for me in
the ward-room, and spent a few minutes with Angela, I joined the
captain and first lieutenant in the former&rsquo;s state-room, and
over a glass of grog, told them briefly, but frankly, something of
my life and adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is the queerest yarn I ever heard; but I dare
say none the less true on that account,&rdquo; said Captain
Bigelow, when I had finished. &ldquo;With that sweet lady for your
wife and your belt full of diamonds, you may esteem yourself one of
the most fortunate of men. And you did quite right to get away from
that place. But what was your point? where did you expect to get to
with that sloop of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Callao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Callao! Why the course you were on would never have taken
you to Callao. Callao lies nor&rsquo; by east, not nor&rsquo; by
west. If you had not fallen in with us, I am afraid you would never
have got anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure we should not. Three days more and we should
have died of thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we put you ashore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is for you to say. Where would it be
convenient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would Panama suit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just the place. We could cross the isthmus to
Chagres; but before going to England, I should like to call at La
Guayra, and find out whether my friend Carmen still
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that easily; but if I were you, and had all
those diamonds in my possession, I would get home as quickly as
possible, and put them in a place of safety. There are men who
would commit a thousand murders for one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shall see. Perhaps I had better consign them to
London through some merchant, and have them insured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you had, especially if you can get somebody to
insure the insurer. And take my advice, don&rsquo;t tell a soul on
board what you have told us. My crew are passably honest, but if
they knew how many diamonds you carried about you, I should be very
sorry to go bail for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I went on deck after our talk, I was met by the surgeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word with you, Mr. Fortescue,&rdquo; he said, gravely,
taking me aside, &ldquo;your wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, what about my wife?&rdquo; I asked, with a
sudden sinking of the heart, for the man&rsquo;s manner was even
more portentous than his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was very ill, and if we had remained longer on the
sloop&mdash;but now&mdash;with nourishing food and your care,
doctor, she will quickly regain her strength. Indeed, she is better
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the moment. But she is very much reduced and the
symptoms are grave. A recurrence of the fever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such a fever is so easily cured. I know what you are
hinting at, doctor. Yet I cannot think&mdash;You will not let her
die. After surmounting so many dangers, and being so miraculously
rescued, and with prospects so fair, it would be too
cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do my best, sir, you may be sure. But I thought it
my duty to prepare you for the worst. The issue is with
God.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>This is a part of my story on which I care not to dwell. Even
yet I cannot think of it without grief and pain. My dear wife was
taken from me. She died in my arms, her hand in mine, as sweetly
and serenely as she had lived. But for Captain Bigelow and his
officers I should have buried myself with Angela in the fathomless
sea. I owed him my life a second time&mdash;such as it
was&mdash;more, for he taught me the duty and grace of resignation,
showed me that, though to cherish the memory of a great sorrow
ennobles a man, he who abandons himself to unmeasured grief is as
pusillanimous as he who shirks his duty on the field of battle.</p>
<p>Captain Bigelow had a great heart and a chivalrous nature. After
Angela&rsquo;s death he treated me more as a cherished son than as
a casual guest. Before we reached Panama we were fast friends. He
provided me with clothing and gave me money for my immediate wants,
as to have attempted to dispose of any of my diamonds there, or at
Chagres, might have exposed me to suspicion, possibly to danger. In
acknowledgement of his kindness and as a souvenir of our
friendship, I persuaded him to accept one of the finest stones in
my collection, and we parted with mutual assurances of goodwill and
not without hope of meeting again.</p>
<p>Ramon of course, went with me. Bill Yawl, equally of of course,
I left behind. He had slung his hammock in the
Constellation&rsquo;s fo&rsquo;castle, and became captain of the
foretop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XXXIV" id="Ch_XXXIV">Chapter XXXIV.</a></h3>
<h2>Old Friends and a New Foe.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I had made up my mind to see Carmen, if he still lived; and
finding at Chagres a schooner bound for La Guayra I took passages
in her for myself and Ramon, all the more willingly as the captain
proposed to put in at Cura&ccedil;oa. It occurred to me that Van
Voorst, the Dutch merchant in whose hands I had left six hundred
pounds, would be a likely man to advise me as to the disposal of my
diamonds&mdash;if he also still lived.</p>
<p>Rather to my surprise, for people die fast in the tropics, I did
find the old gentleman alive, but he had made so sure of my death
that my reappearance almost caused his. The pipe he was smoking
dropped from his mouth, and he sank back in his chair with an
exclamation of fear and dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yor need not be alarmed, Mynheer Van Voorst,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;I am in the flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you in the flesh. I don&rsquo;t believe
in ghosts, of course. But I happened to be in what you call a brown
study, and as I had heard you were shot long ago on the llanos you
rather startled me, coming in so quietly&mdash;that rascally boy
ought to have announced you. But I was not afraid&mdash;not in the
least. Why should one be afraid of a ghost! And I saw at a glance
that, as you say, you were in the flesh. I suppose you have come to
inquire about your money. It is quite safe, my dear sir, and at
your disposal, and you will find that it has materially increased.
I will call for the ledger, and you shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ledger was brought in by a business-looking young man, whom
the old merchant introduced to me as his nephew and partner,
Mynheer Bernhard Van Voorst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Fortescue, Bernhard,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the English gentleman who was dead&mdash;I mean that I
thought he was dead, but is alive&mdash;and who many years ago left
in my hands a sum of about two thousand piasters. Turn to his
account and see how much there is now to his credit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the last balance the amount to Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s
credit was six thousand two hundred
piasters.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup><span class="sidenote">2. At the time
in question, &ldquo;piaster&rdquo; was a word often used as an
equivalent for &ldquo;dollar,&rdquo; both in the &ldquo;Gulf
ports&rdquo; and the West Indies.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You see! Did I not say so? Your capital is more than
doubled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than doubled! How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have credited you with the colonial rate of
interest&mdash;ten per cent.&mdash;as was only right, seeing that
you had no security, and we had used the money in our business; and
my friend, compound interest at ten per cent, is a great
institution. It beats gold-mining, and is almost as profitable as
being President of the Republic of Venezuela. How will you take
your balance, Mr. Fortescue? We will have the account made up to
date. I can give you half the amount in hard money&mdash;coin is
not too plentiful just now in Cura&ccedil;oa, half in drafts at
seven days&rsquo; sight on the house of Goldberg, Van Voorst &amp;
Company, at Amsterdam, or Spring &amp; Gerolstein, at London. They
are a young firm, but do a safe business and work with a large
capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am greatly obliged to you but all I require at present
is about five hundred piasters, in hard money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah then, you have made money where you have been?&rdquo;
observed Mr. Van Voorst, eying me keenly through his great horn
spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not money, but money&rsquo;s worth,&rdquo; I replied, for
I had quite decided to make a confident of the honest old Dutchman,
whom I liked all the better for going straight to the point without
asking too many questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be merchandise and merchandise is
money&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is merchandise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it be readily salable in this island or on the Spanish
Main we shall be glad to receive it from you on consignment and
make you a liberal advance against bills of lading. Hardware and
cotton prints are in great demand just now, and if it is anything
of that sort we might sell it to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing of that sort, Mr. Van Voorst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More portable, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, more portable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could show me a sample&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can show you the bulk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have got it in the schooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have got it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold dust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diamonds. I found them in the Andes, and shall be glad to
have your advice as to their disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diamonds! Ach! you are a happy man. If you would like to
show me them I can perhaps give you some idea of their value. The
house of Goldberg &amp; Van Voorst, at Amsterdam, in which I was
brought up, deal largely in precious stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this I undid my belt and poured the diamonds on a large sheet
of white paper, which Mr. Van Voorst spread on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mein Gott! Mein Gott!</em>&rdquo; he exclaimed in
ecstacy, glaring at the diamonds through his big glasses and
picking out the finest with his fat fingers. &ldquo;This is the
finest collection of rough stones I ever did see. They are
worth&mdash;until they are weighed and cut it is impossible to say
how much&mdash;but at least a million dollars, probably two
millions. You found them in the Andes? You could not say where,
could you, Mr. Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could, but I would rather not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon. I should have known better than to
ask. You intend to go there again, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! It would be at the risk of my life&mdash;and there
are other reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need. You are rich already, and enough is as
good as a feast. You ask my advice as to the disposal of these
stones. Well, my advice is that you consign them, through us, to
the house of Goldberg, Van Voorst &amp; Company. They are honest
and experienced. They will get them cut and sell them for you at
the highest price. They are, moreover, one of the richest houses in
Amsterdam, trustworthy without limit. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will act on your advice, and consign these stones
to your friends for sale at Amsterdam, or elsewhere, as they may
think best. And be good enough to ask them to advise me as to the
investment of the proceeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will do that with pleasure, mine friend, and having
financial relations with every monetary centre in Europe they
command the best information. And now we must count and weigh these
stones carefully, and I shall give you a receipt in proper form.
They must be shipped in three or four parcels so as to divide the
risk, and I will write to Goldberg &amp; Van Voorst to take out
open policies &lsquo;by ship or ships&rsquo;&mdash;for how much
shall we say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I must leave to you, Mr. Van Voorst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will say two million dollars&mdash;better make it
too much than too little&mdash;and two millions may not be too
much. I do not profess to be an expert, and, as likely as not, my
estimate is very wide of the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the diamonds had been counted and weighed, and a receipt
written out, in duplicate and in two languages, I informed Mr. Van
Voorst of my intention to visit Caracas and asked whether things
were pretty quiet there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Caracas itself, yes. But in the interior they are
fighting, as usual. The curse of Spanish rule has been succeeded by
the still greater curse of chronic revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But foreigners are admitted, I suppose? I run no risk of
being clapped in prison as I was last time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least. You can go and come as you please. You
don&rsquo;t even require a passport. The Spaniards, who were once
so hated, are now almost popular. I hear that several Spanish
officers, who served in the royal army during the war, are now at
Caracas, and have offered their swords to the government for the
suppression of the present rebellion. Do you intend to stay long in
Venezuela?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. In any case I shall see you before I leave
for Europe. Much depends on whether I find my friend Carmen
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen, Carmen! I seem to know the name. Is he a
general?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarcely, I should think. He was only a <em>teniente</em>
of guerillas when we parted some ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all generals now, my dear sir, and as plentiful
as frogs in my native land. If you are ever in doubt as to the rank
of a Venezolano, you are always safe in addressing him as a
general. Yes, I fancy you will find your friend alive. At any rate,
there is a General Carmen, rather a leading man among the Blues, I
think, and sometimes spoken of as a probable president. You will,
of course, put up at the Hotel de los Generales. Ah, here is
Bernhard with the five hundred dollars in hard money, for which you
asked. If you should want more, draw on us at sight. I will give
you a letter of introduction to the house of Bl&uuml;hm &amp;
Bluthner at Caracas, who will be glad to cash your drafts at the
current rate of exchange, and to whose care I will address any
letters I may have occasion to write to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This concluded my business with Mr. Van Voorst, and three days
later I was once more in Caracas. I found the place very little
altered, less than I was myself. I had entered it in high spirits,
full of hope, eager for adventure, and intent on making my fortune.
Now my heart was heavy with sorrow and bitter with disappointment.
Though I had made my fortune, I had lost, as I thought, both the
buoyancy of youth and the capacity for enjoyment, and I looked
forward to the future without either hope or desire.</p>
<p>As I rode with Ramon into the <em>patio</em> of the hotel, where
I had been arrested by the alguazils of the Spanish governor, a man
came forward to greet me, so strikingly like the ancient
<em>posadero</em> that I felt sure he was the latter&rsquo;s son.
My surmise proved correct, and I afterwards heard, not without a
sense of satisfaction, that the father was hanged by the patriots
when they recaptured Caracas.</p>
<p>After I had engaged my rooms the <em>posadero</em> informed me
(in answer to my inquiry) that General Salvador Carmen (this could
be none other than my old friend) was with the army at La Victoria,
but that he had a house at Caracas where his wife and family were
then residing. He also mentioned incidentally that several Spanish
officers of distinction, who had arrived a few days previously,
were staying in the <em>posada</em>&mdash;doubtless the same spoken
of by Van Voorst.</p>
<p>The day being still young, for I had left La Guayra betimes, I
thought I could not do better than call on Juanita, who lived only
a stone&rsquo;s throw from the Hotel de los Generales. She
recognized me at once and received me&mdash;almost
literally&mdash;with open arms. When I essayed to kiss her hand,
she offered me her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this long time! It is a miracle!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;We mourned for you as one dead; for we felt sure
that if you were living we should have had news of you. How glad
Salvador will be! Where have you been all this time, and why, oh
why, did you not write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been in the heart of the Andes, and I did not
write because I was as much cut off from the world as if I had been
in another planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have a long story to tell us, then. But I am
forgetting the most important question of all. Are you still a
bachelor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than that, Juanita. I am a widower. I have lost the
sweetest wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Misericordia! Misericordia! Pobre amigo mio!</em> Oh,
how sorry I am; how much I pity you!&rdquo; And the dear lady, now
a stately and handsome matron, fell a-weeping out of pure
tenderness, and I had to tell her the sad story of the quenching of
Quipai and Angela&rsquo;s death. But the telling of it, together
with Juanita&rsquo;s sympathy, did me good, and I went away in much
better spirits than I had come. Salvador, she said, would be back
in a few days, and she much regretted not being able to offer me
quarters; it was contrary to the custom of the place and Spanish
etiquette for ladies to entertain gentlemen visitors during their
husbands&rsquo; absence.</p>
<p>After leaving Juanita I walked round by the guard-house in which
I had been imprisoned, and through the ruins where Carmen and I had
hidden when we were making our escape. They suggested some stirring
memories&mdash;Carera (who, as I learned from Juanita, had been
dead several years) and his chivalrous friendship; Salvador and his
reckless courage; our midnight ride; Gahra and the bivouac by the
mountain-tarn (poor Gahra, what had become of him?); Majia and his
guerillas; Griscelli and his blood-hounds (how I hated that man,
but surely by this time he had got his deserts); Gondocori and
Queen Mamcuna; the man-killer; and Quipai.</p>
<p>My mind was still busied with these memories when I reached the
hotel. There seemed to be much more going on than there had been
earlier in the day&mdash;horsemen were coming and going, servants
hurrying to and fro, people promenading on the <em>patio</em>, a
group of uniformed officers deep in conversation. One of them, a
tall, rather stout man, with grizzled hair, a pair of big
epaulettes, and a coat covered with gold lace, had his back toward
me, and as my eye fell on his sword-hilt it struck me that I had
seen something like it before. I was trying to think where, when
the owner of it turned suddenly round, and I found myself face to
face with&mdash;GRISCELLI!!</p>
<p>For some seconds we stared at each other in blank amazement. I
could see that though he recognized me, he was trying to make
believe that he did not; or, perhaps, he really doubted whether I
was the man I seemed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my sword,&rdquo; I said, pointing to the weapon
by his side, which had been given to me by Carera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sword! What do you mean?&rdquo; &ldquo;You took it
from me eleven years ago, when I fell into your hands at San
Felipe, and you hunted my friend Carmen and myself with
bloodhounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What folly is this? Hunted you with bloodhounds,
forsooth! Why, this is the first time I ever set eyes on
you&mdash;the man is mad&mdash;or drunk&rdquo; (addressing his
friends).</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie, Griscelli; and you are not a liar merely, but a
murderer and a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Por Dios</em>, you shall pay for this insult with
your heart&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo; he shouted, furiously, half
drawing his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like you to draw on an unarmed man.&rdquo; I said,
laying hold of his wrist. &ldquo;Give me a sword, and you shall
make me pay for the insult with my blood&mdash;if you can.
Se&ntilde;ores&rdquo; (by this time all the people in the
<em>patio</em> had gathered round us), &ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores, are
there here any Venezuelan caballeros who will bear me out in this
quarrel. I am an Englishman, by name Fortescue; eleven years ago,
while serving under General Mejia on the patriot side, I fell into
the hands of General Griscelli, who deprived me of the sword he now
wears, which I received as a present from Se&ntilde;or Carera,
whose name you may remember. Then, after deceiving us with false
promises&mdash;my friend General Carmen and myself&mdash;he hunted
us with his bloodhounds, and we escaped as by a miracle. Now he
protests that he never saw me before. What say you, se&ntilde;ores,
am I not right in stigmatizing him as a murderer and
liar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right!&rdquo; said a middle-aged, soldierly-looking
man. I also served in the war of liberation, and remember
Griscelli&rsquo;s name well. It would serve him right to poniard
him on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. I want no murder. I demand only
satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he shall give it you or take the consequences. I will
gladly act as one witness, and I am sure my friend here,
Se&ntilde;or Don Luis de Medina, who is also a veteran of the war,
will act as the other. Will you fight, Griscelli?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;provided that we fight at once, and to
the death. You can arrange the details with my friends
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;<em>A la
muerte.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the death! To the death!&rdquo; shouted the crowd,
whose native ferocity was now thoroughly roused.</p>
<p>After a short conference and a reference to Griscelli and
myself, the seconds announced that we were to fight with swords in
Se&ntilde;or de Medina&rsquo;s garden, whither we straightway
wended, for there were no police to meddle with us, and at that
time duels <em>a la muerte</em> were of daily occurrence in the
city of Caracas. When we arrived at the garden, which was only a
stone&rsquo;s-throw walk from the <em>posada</em>, Se&ntilde;or de
Medina produced two swords with cutting edges, and blades five feet
long; for we were to fight in Spanish fashion, and Spanish duelists
both cut and thrust, and, when occasion serves, use the left hand
as a help in parrying.</p>
<p>Then the spectators, of whom there were fully two score, made a
ring, and Griscelli and I (having meanwhile doffed our hats, coats,
and shirts), stepped into the arena.</p>
<p>I had not handled a sword for years, and for aught I knew
Griscelli might be a consummate swordsman and in daily practice. On
the other hand, he was too stout to be in first-rate condition,
and, besides being younger, I had slightly the advantage in length
of arm.</p>
<p>When the word was given to begin, he opened the attack with
great energy and resolution, and was obviously intent on killing me
if he could. For a minute or two it was all I could do to hold my
own; and partly to test his strength and skill, partly to get my
hand in, I stood purposely on the defensive.</p>
<p>At the end of the first bout neither of us had received a
scratch, but Griscelli showed signs of fatigue while I was quite
fresh. Also he was very angry and excited, and when we resumed he
came at me with more than his former impetuosity, as if he meant to
bear me down by the sheer weight and rapidity of his strokes. His
favorite attack was a cut aimed at my head. Six several times he
repeated this manoeuvre, and six times I stopped the stroke with
the usual guard. Baffled and furious, he tried it again,
but&mdash;probably because of failing strength&mdash;less swiftly
and adroitly. My opportunity had come. Quick as thought I ran under
his guard, and, thrusting his right arm aside with my left hand,
passed my sword through his body.</p>
<p>Then there were cries of bravo, for the popular feeling was on
my side, and my seconds congratulated me warmly on my victory. But
I said little in reply, my attention being attracted by a young man
who was kneeling beside Griscelli&rsquo;s body and, as it might
seem, saying a silent prayer. When he had done he rose to his feet,
and as I looked on his face I saw he was the dead man&rsquo;s
son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you have killed my father, and I shall kill
you,&rdquo; he said, in a calm voice, but with intense passion.
&ldquo;Yes, I shall kill you, and if I fail my cousins will kill
you. If you escape us all, then we will charge our children to
avenge the death of the man you have this day slain. We are
Corsicans, and we never forgive. I know your name; mine is Giuseppe
Griscelli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are distraught with grief, and know not what you
say,&rdquo; I said as kindly as I could, for I pitied the lad.
&ldquo;But let not your grief make you unjust. Your father died in
fair fight. If I had not killed him he would have killed me, and
years ago he tried to hunt me to death for his
amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I and mine&mdash;we will hunt you to death for our
revenge. Or will you fight now? I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have no quarrel with you, and I should be sorry to
hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go your way, then, but remember&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better leave him; he seems half-crazed,&rdquo; interposed
Medina. &ldquo;Come into my house while my slaves remove the
body.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A Novel Wager.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Three days afterward Carmen, apprised by his wife of my arrival,
returned to Caracas, and I became their guest, greatly to my
satisfaction, for the duel with Griscelli, besides making me
temporarily famous, had brought me so many friends and invitations
that I knew not how to dispose of them.</p>
<p>In discussing the incident with Salvador, I expressed surprise
that Griscelli should have dared to return to a country where he
had committed so many cruelties and made so many enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left Venezuela the year after you disappeared, and
much is forgotten in ten years,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;All
the same, I don&rsquo;t suppose he would have come back if
Olivarez&mdash;the last president and a Yellow&mdash;had not made
it known that he would bestow commissions on Spanish officers of
distinction and give them commands in the national army. It was a
most absurd proceeding. But we shot Olivarez three months ago, and
I will see that these Spanish interlopers are sent out of the
country forthwith, that young spark who threatens to murder you,
included.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him stay if he likes. I doubt whether he meant what
he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of it, whatever, <em>amigo mio</em>, and
he shall go. If he stayed in the country I could not answer for
your safety; and if you come across any of the Griscellis in
Europe, take my advice and be as watchful as if you were crossing a
river infested with <em>caribe</em> fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen was much discouraged by the state of the republic, as
well he might be. By turning out the Spaniards the former colonies
had merely exchanged despotism for anarchy; instead of being beaten
with whips they were beaten with scorpions. But though discouraged
Carmen was not dismayed. He belonged to the Blues, who being in
power, regarded their opponents, the Yellows, as rebels; and he was
confident that the triumph of his party would insure the
tranquillity of the country. As he was careful to explain to me, he
was a Blue because he was a patriot, and he pressed me so warmly to
return with him to La Victoria, accept a command in his army, and
aid in the suppression of the insurrection, that I ended by
consenting.</p>
<p>At Carmen&rsquo;s instance, the president gave me the command of
a brigade, and would have raised me to the rank of general. But
when I found that there were about three generals for every colonel
I chose the nominally inferior but actually more distinguished
grade.</p>
<p>I remained in Venezuela two years, campaigning nearly all the
time. But it was an ignoble warfare, cruel and ruthless, and had I
not given my word to Carmen, to stand by him until the country was
pacified, I should have resigned my commission much sooner than I
did. Ramon, who acted as one of my orderlies, bore himself bravely
and was several times wounded.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile I received several communications from Van
Voorst, and made two visits to Cura&ccedil;oa. The cutting and
disposal of my diamonds being naturally rather a long business, it
was nearly two years after I had shipped them to Holland before I
learned the result of my venture.</p>
<p>After all expenses were paid they brought me nearly three
hundred thousand pounds, which account Goldberg, Van Voorst &amp;
Company &ldquo;held at my disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was to arrange and advise with the Amsterdam people, as to
the investment of this great fortune, that I went to Europe. But I
did not depart until my promise was fulfilled. I left Venezuela
pacified&mdash;from exhaustion&mdash;and Carmen in somewhat better
spirits than I had found him.</p>
<p>His last words were a warning, which I have had frequent
occasion to remember: &ldquo;Beware of the Griscellis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sailed from Cura&ccedil;oa (Ramon, of course, accompanying
me), in a Dutch ship, bound for Rotterdam, whither I arrived in due
course, and proceeding thence to Amsterdam, introduced myself to
Goldberg, Van Voorst &amp; Company. They were a weighty and
respectable firm in every sense of the term, and received me with a
ponderous gravity befitting the occasion.</p>
<p>Though extremely courteous in their old-fashioned way, they
neither wasted words nor asked unnecessary questions. But they made
me a momentous proposal&mdash;no less than to become their partner.
They had an ample capital for their original trade of diamond
merchants; but having recently become contractors for government
loans, they had opportunities of turning my fortune to much better
account than investing it in ordinary securities. Goldberg &amp;
Company did not make it a condition that I should take an active
part in the business&mdash;that would be just as I pleased. After
being fully enlightened as to the nature of their transactions, and
looking at their latest balance-sheets, I closed with the offer,
and I have never had occasion to regret my decision. We opened
branch houses in London and Paris; the firm is now one of the
largest of its kind in Europe; we reckon our capital by millions,
and, as I have lived long, and had no children to provide for, the
amount standing to my credit exceeds that of all the other partners
put together, and yields me a princely income.</p>
<p>But I could not settle down to the monotonous career of a
merchant, and though I have always taken an interest in the
business of the house, and on several important occasions acted as
its special agent in the greater capitals, my life since that
time&mdash;a period of nearly fifty years&mdash;has been spent
mainly in foreign travel and scientific study. I have revisited
South America and recrossed the Andes, ridden on horseback from
Vera Cruz to San Francisco, and from San Francisco to the
headwaters of the Mississippi and the Missouri. I served in the war
between Belgium and Holland, went through the Mexican campaign of
1846, fought with Sam Houston at the battle of San Jacinto, and was
present, as a spectator, at the fall of Sebastopol and the capture
of Delhi. In the course of my wanderings I have encountered many
moving accidents by flood and field. Once I was captured by Greek
brigands, after a desperate fight, in which both Ramon and myself
were wounded, and had to pay four thousand pounds for my ransom.
For the last twenty years, however, I have avoided serious risks,
done no avoidable fighting, and travelled only in beaten tracks;
and, unless I am killed by one of the Griscelli, I dare say I shall
live twenty years longer.</p>
<p>While studying therapeutics and pathology under Professor
Giessler, of Zurich, shortly after my return to Europe, I took up
the subject of longevity, as to which Giessler had collected much
curious information, and formed certain theories, one being that
people of sound constitution and strong vitality, with no
hereditary predisposition to disease may, by observing a correct
regimen, easily live to be a hundred, preserving until that age
their faculties virtually intact&mdash;in other words, only begin
to be old at a hundred. So far I agree with him, but as to what
constituted a &ldquo;correct regimen&rdquo; we differed. He held
that the life most conducive to length of years was that of the
scholar&mdash;his own, in fact&mdash;regular, uneventful,
reflective, and sedentary. I, on the other hand, thought that the
man who passed much of his time in the open air, moving about and
using his limbs, would live the longer&mdash;other things being
equal, and assuming that both observed the accepted rules of
health.</p>
<p>The result of our discussion was a friendly wager. &ldquo;You
try your way; I will try mine,&rdquo; said Giessler, &ldquo;and we
will see who lives the longer&mdash;at any rate, the survivor will.
The survivor must also publish an account of his system, <em>pour
encourageur les autres</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we were of the same age, equally sound in constitution and
strong in physique, and not greatly dissimilar in temperament, I
accepted the challenge. The competition is still going on. Every
New Year&rsquo;s day we write each other a letter, always in the
same words, which both answers and asks the same questions:
&ldquo;Still alive?&rdquo; If either fails to receive his letter at
the specified time, he will presume that the other is <em>hors de
combat</em>, if not dead, and make further inquiry. But I think I
shall win. Three years ago I met Giessler at the meeting of the
British Association, and, though he denied it, he was palpably
aging. His shoulders were bent, his hearing and eye-sight failing,
and the <em>area senilis</em> was very strongly marked, while
I&mdash;am what you see.</p>
<p>I have, however, had an advantage over the professor, which it
is only fair to mention. In my wanderings I have always taken
occasion, when opportunity offered, to observe the habits of tribes
who are remarkable for longevity. None are more remarkable in this
respect than the Callavayas of the Andes, and I satisfied myself
that they do really live long, though perhaps not so long as some
of them say. Now, these people are herbalists, and when they reach
middle age make a practice of drinking a decoction which, as they
believe, has the power of prolonging life. I brought with me to
Europe specimens and seeds of the plant (peculiar to the region)
from which the simple is distilled, analyzed the one and cultivated
the other. The conclusion at which I arrived was, that the plant in
question did actually possess the property of retarding that
softening of the arteries which more than anything else causes the
decrepitude of old age. It contains a peculiar alkaloid of which,
for thirty years past, I had taken (in solution) a much-diluted
dose almost daily. You see the result. I also give Ramon an
occasional dose, and he is the most vigorous man of his years I
know. I sent some to Giessler, but he said it was an empirical
remedy, and declined to take it. He preferred electric baths. I
take my electric baths by horseback exercise, and riding to
hounds.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe I shall finish my century&mdash;without becoming
senile either in body or mind&mdash;if I can escape the Griscelli.
I was in hopes that I had escaped them by coming here; but I never
stay long in Europe that they don&rsquo;t sooner or later find me
out. I think I shall have to spend the remainder of my life in
America or the East. The consciousness of being continually hunted,
that at any moment I may be confronted with a murderer and
perchance be murdered, is too trying for a man of my age. To tell
the truth, I am beginning to feel that I have nerves; though my
elixir delays death, it does not insure perpetual youth; and
propitiating these people is out of the question&mdash;I have tried
it.</p>
<p>Three years after my return from Venezuela, Guiseppe, son of the
man whom I killed at Caracas, tried to kill me at Amsterdam, fired
at me point-blank with a duelling pistol, and so nearly succeeded
that the bullet grazed my cheek and cut a piece out of my ear. Yet
I not only pardoned him, but bribed the police to let him go, and
gave him money. Well, seven years later he repeated the attempt at
Naples, waylaid me at night and attacked me with a dagger, but I
also happened to be armed, and Guiseppi Griscelli died.</p>
<p>At Paris, too&mdash;indeed, while the empire lasted&mdash;I
found it expedient to shun France altogether. At that time
Corsicans were greatly in favor; several members of the Griscelli
family belonged to the secret police and had great influence, and
as I never took an <em>alias</em> and my name is not common, I was
tracked like a criminal. Once I had to leave Paris by stealth at
dead of night; another time I saved my life by simulating death.
But why recount all the attempts on my life? Another time, perhaps.
The subject is not a pleasant one, but this I will say: I never
spared a Griscelli that I had not cause to regret my clemency. The
last I spared was the young man who tried to murder me down in the
wood there; and if he does not repay my forbearance by repeating
the attempt, he will be false to the traditions of his race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="Ch_XXXVI" id="Ch_XXXVI">Chapter XXXVI.</a></h3>
<h2>Epilogue.</h2>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe that the deciphering of Mr.
Fortescue&rsquo;s notes and the writing of his memoirs were not
done in a day. There were gaps to be filled up, obscure passages to
be elucidated, and parts of several chapters and the whole of the
last were written to his dictation, so that the summer came and
went, and another hunting-season was &ldquo;in view,&rdquo; before
my work, in its present shape, was completed. I would fain have
made it more complete by giving a fuller account of Mr.
Fortescue&rsquo;s adventures (some of which must have been very
remarkable) between his first return from South America and his
appearance at Matching Green, and I should doubtless have been able
to do so (for he had promised to continue and amplify his narrative
during the winter, as also to give me the recipe of his elixir),
had not our intercourse been abruptly terminated by one of the
strangest events in my experience and, I should think, in his.</p>
<p>But, before going further, I would just observe that Mr.
Fortescue&rsquo;s cynicism, which, when I first knew him, had
rather repelled me, was only skin-deep. Though he held human life
rather cheaper than I quite liked, he was a kind and liberal master
and a generous giver. His largesses were often princely and
invariably anonymous, for he detested everything that savored of
ostentation and parade. On the other hand, he had no more tolerance
for mendicants in broadcloth than for beggars in rags, and to those
who asked he gave nothing. As an instance of his dislike of
publicity, I may mention that I had been with him several months
before I discovered that he had published, under a pseudonym,
several scientific works which, had he acknowledged them, would
have made him famous.</p>
<p>After Guiseppe Griscelli&rsquo;s attempt on his life, I
prevailed on Mr. Fortescue never to go outside the park gates
unaccompanied; when he went to town, or to Amsterdam, Ramon always
went with him, and both were armed. I also gave strict orders to
the lodge-keepers to admit no strangers without authority, and to
give me immediate information as to any suspicious-looking
characters whom they might see loitering about.</p>
<p>These precautions, I thought, would be quite sufficient to
prevent any attack being made on Mr. Fortescue in the daytime. It
was less easy to guard against a surprise during the night, for the
park-palings were not so high as to be unclimbable; and the idea of
a night-watchman was suggested only to be dismissed, for the very
sufficient reason that when he was most wanted he would almost
certainly be asleep. I had no fear of Griscelli breaking in at the
front door; but the house was not burglar-proof, and, as it
happened, the weak point in our defence was one of the windows of
Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s bedroom. It looked into the orchard, and, by
climbing a tree which grew hard by, an active man could easily
reach it, even without a ladder. The danger was all the greater,
as, when the weather was mild, Mr. Fortescue always slept with the
window open. I proposed iron bars, to which he objected that iron
bars would make his room look like a prison. And then I had a happy
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us fix a strong brass rod right across the
window-frame,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in such a way that nobody can
get in without laying hold of it, and by connecting it with a
strong dynamo-battery inside, make sure that the man who does lay
hold of it will not be able to let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea pleased Mr. Fortescue, and he told me to carry it out,
which I did promptly and effectively, taking care to make the
battery so powerful that, if Mr. Griscelli should try to effect an
entrance by the window, he would be disagreeably surprised. The
circuit was, of course, broken by dividing the rod in two parts and
interposing a non-conductor between them.</p>
<p>To prevent any of the maids being &ldquo;shocked,&rdquo; I told
Ramon (who acted as his master&rsquo;s body servant) to connect the
battery every night and disconnect it every morning. From time to
time, moreover, I overhauled the apparatus to see that it was in
good working order, and kept up its strength by occasionally
recharging the cells.</p>
<p>Once, when I was doing this, Mr. Fortescue said, laughingly:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is any use, Bacon; Griscelli
won&rsquo;t come in that way. If, as some people say, it is the
unexpected that happens, it is the expected that does not
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in this instance both happened&mdash;the expected and the
unexpected.</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the outset of my story, the habits of the
Kingscote household were of an exemplary regularity. Mr. Fortescue,
who rose early, expected everybody else to follow his example in
this respect, and, as a rule, everybody did so.</p>
<p>One morning, at the beginning of October, when the sun rose
about six o&rsquo;clock, and we rose with it, I got up, donned my
dressing-gown, and went, as usual, to take my matutinal bath. In
order to reach the bath-room I had to pass Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s
chamber-door. As I neared it I heard within loud exclamations of
horror and dismay, in a voice which I recognized as the voice of
Ramon. Thinking that something was wrong, that Mr. Fortescue had
perchance been taken suddenly ill, I pushed open the door and
entered without ceremony.</p>
<p>Mr. Fortescue was sitting up in bed, looking with startled gaze
at the window; and Ramon stood in the middle of the room, aghast
and dismayed.</p>
<p>And well he might, for there hung at the window a man&mdash;or
the body of one&mdash;his hands convulsively grasping the
magnetized rod, the distorted face pressed against the glass, the
lack-lustre eyes wide open, the jaw drooping. In that ghastly
visage I recognized the features of Giuseppe Griscelli!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he dead, doctor?&rdquo; asked Mr. Fortescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been dead several hours,&rdquo; I said, as I
examined the corpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better; the brood is one less, and perhaps
after this they will let me live in peace. They must see that so
far as their attempts against it are concerned, I bear a charmed
life. You have done me a great service, Doctor Bacon, and I hold
myself your debtor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramon and I disconnected the battery and dragged the body into
the room. We found in the pockets a butcher&rsquo;s knife and a
revolver, and round the waist a rope, with which the would-be
murderer had doubtless intended to descend from the window after
accomplishing his purpose.</p>
<p>This incident, of course, caused a great sensation both at
Kingscote and in the country-side, and, equally of course, there
was an inquest, at which Mr. Fortescue, Ramon, and myself, were the
only witnesses. As Mr. Fortescue did not want it to be known that
he was the victim of a <em>vendetta</em>, and detested the idea of
having himself and his affairs discussed by the press, we were
careful not to gainsay the popular belief that Griscelli was
neither more nor less than a dangerous and resolute burglar, and,
as his possession of lethal weapons proved, a potential murderer.
As for the cause of death I said, as I then fully believed (though
I have since had occasion to modify this opinion somewhat), that
the battery was not strong enough to kill a healthy man, and that
Griscelli had died of nervous shock and fear acting on a weak
heart. In this view the jury concurred and returned a verdict of
accidental death, with the (informal) rider that it &ldquo;served
him right.&rdquo; The chairman, a burly farmer, warmly
congratulated me on my ingenuity, and regretted that he had not
&ldquo;one of them things&rdquo; at every window in his house.</p>
<p>So far so good; but, unfortunately, a London paper which lived
on sensation, and happened at the moment to be in want of a new
one, took the matter up. One of the editor&rsquo;s jackals came
down to Kingscote, and there and elsewhere picked up a few facts
concerning Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s antecedents and habits, which he
served up to his readers in a highly spiced and amazingly
mendacious article, entitled &ldquo;old Fortescue and his Strange
Fortunes.&rdquo; But the sting of the article was in its tail. The
writer threw doubt on the justice of the verdict. It remained to be
proved, he said, that Griscelli was a burglar, and his death
accidental. And even burglars had their rights. The law assumed
them to be innocent until they were proved to be guilty, and it
could be permitted neither to Mr. Fortescue nor to any other man to
take people&rsquo;s lives, merely because he suspected them of an
intention to come in by the window instead of the door. By what
right, he asked, did Mr. Fortescue place on his window an appliance
as dangerous as forked lightning, and as deadly as dynamite? What
was the difference between magnetized bars in a window and
spring-guns on a game-preserve? In conclusion, the writer demanded
a searching investigation into the circumstances attending Guiseppe
Griscelli&rsquo;s death, likewise the immediate passing of an act
of Parliament forbidding, under heavy penalties, the use of
magnetic batteries as a defence against supposed burglars.</p>
<p>This effusion (which he read in a marked copy of the paper
obligingly forwarded by the enterprising editor) put Mr. Fortescue
in a terrible passion, which made him, for a moment, look younger
than ever I had seen him look before. The outrage rekindled the
fire of his youth; he seemed to grow taller, his eyes glowed with
anger, and, had the enterprising editor been present, he would have
passed a very bad quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow who wrote this is worse than a
murderer!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot
him&mdash;unless he prefers cold steel, and then I shall serve him
as I served General Griscelli; and &rsquo;pon my soul I believe
Griscelli was the least rascally of the two! I would as lief be
hunted by blood-hounds as be stabbed in the back by anonymous
slanderers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he wanted me to take a challenge to the enterprising
editor, and arrange for a meeting, which rendered it necessary to
remind him that we were not in the England of fifty years ago, and
that duelling was abolished, and that his traducer would not only
refuse to fight, but denounce his challenger to the police and
gibbet him in his paper. I pointed out, on the other hand, that the
article was clearly libellous, and recommended Mr. Fortescue either
to obtain a criminal information against the proprietor of the
paper, or sue him for damages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; he answered, with a gesture of
indignation and disdain&mdash;&ldquo;no, sir, I shall neither
obtain a criminal information nor sue for damages. The man who goes
to law surrenders his liberty of action and becomes the sport of
chicaning lawyers and hair-splitting judges. I would rather lose a
hundred thousand pounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fortescue passed the remainder of the day at his desk,
writing and arranging his papers. The next morning I heard, without
surprise, that he and Ramon were going abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I shall return,&rdquo; said Mr.
Fortescue, as we shook hands at the hall door, &ldquo;but act as
you always do when I am from home, and in the course of a few days
you will hear from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did hear from him, and what I heard was of a nature so
surprising as nearly to take my breath away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never see me at Kingscote again,&rdquo; he
wrote; &ldquo;I am going to a country where I shall be safe, as
well from the attacks of Corsican assassins as from the cowardly
outrages of rascally newspapers.&rdquo; And then he gave
instructions as to the disposal of his property at Kingscote.
Certain things, which he enumerated, were to be packed up in cases
and forwarded to Amsterdam. The furniture and effects in and about
the house were to be sold, and the proceeds placed at the disposal
of the county authorities for the benefit of local charities. Every
outdoor servant was to receive six months&rsquo; pay, every in-door
servant twelve months&rsquo; pay, in lieu of notice. Geirt was to
join Mr. Fortescue in a month&rsquo;s time at Damascus; and to me,
in lieu of notice, and as evidence of his regard, he gave all his
horses, carriages, saddlery, harness, and stable equipments (not
being freehold) of every description whatsoever, to be dealt with
as I thought fit for my personal advantage. His solicitors, with my
help, would wind up his affairs, and his bankers had instructions
to discharge all his liabilities.</p>
<p>His memoirs, or so much of them as I had written down, I might
(if I thought they would interest anybody) publish, but not before
the fiftieth year of the Victorian era, or the death of the German
emperor, whichever event happened first. The letter concluded thus:
&ldquo;I strongly advise you to buy a practice and settle down to
steady work. We may meet again. If I live to be a hundred, you
shall hear from me. If I die sooner you will probably hear of my
demise from the house at Amsterdam, to whom please send your new
address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was exceedingly sorry to lose Mr. Fortescue. Our intercourse
had been altogether pleasant and agreeable, and to myself
personally in a double sense profitable; for he had taught me many
things and rewarded me beyond my deserts. Also the breaking up of
Kingscote and the disposal of the household went much against the
grain. Yet I freely confess that Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s splendid
gift proved a very effective one, and almost reconciled me to his
absence.</p>
<p>All the horses and carriages, except five of the former, and two
traps, I sent up to Tattersall&rsquo;s. As the horses, without
exception, were of the right sort, most of them perfect hunters,
and it was known that Mr. Fortescue would not have an unsound or
vicious animal in his stables, they fetched high prices. The sale
brought me over six thousand pounds. Two-thirds of this I put out
at interest on good security; with the remainder I bought a house
and practice in a part of the county as to which I will merely
observe that it is pleasantly situated and within reach of three
packs of hounds. The greater part of the year I work hard at my
profession; but when November comes round I engage a second
assistant and (weather permitting) hunt three and sometimes four
days a week, so long as the season lasts.</p>
<p>And often when hounds are running hard and I am well up, or when
I am &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; homeward after a good day&rsquo;s sport,
I think gratefully of the man to whom I owe so much, and wonder
whether I shall ever see him again.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
